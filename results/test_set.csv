This will help prevent you from further injuring yourself, especially if you're recovering for a broken clavicle. Begin by unfolding the brace and laying it flat to identify the left and right straps. Undo the Velcro closures on the ends of the straps. Have the person helping you position the felt back pad behind your shoulder blades with the plastic triangle pointing down. Have them carefully wrap the left strap over your left shoulder and under your armpit. They should feed the end of the left strap through the left side of the plastic triangle buckle and attach the Velcro closure. Repeat this process with the right strap. The brace should now be in a ""figure 8"" shape. To adjust the fit, the person helping should pull the straps tighter, or loosen the straps until your desired level of clavicle or posture support is reached. Make sure they adjust one strap at a time to prevent further injury. Once on and properly adjusted, you should feel your shoulders being gently pulled back. If you experience any pain or discomfort, have the straps loosened. If you would like to see more information "

We know it's all mapped out where L three the nerve coming out of L three and your Lumbar spine where that goes down in your leg, you know what? L five goes down the top of your foot if you feel symptoms there. - Right.

You're usually laying flat and you're gonna go ahead and you're gonna push the patella. So here's the kneecap. I'm gonna push it down. I'm gonna push it up. And I'm also gonna push it towards the other knee. - Yep. Towards the in central medial. - So you gotta be relaxed to do this, but you you see I'm pushing down. You're gonna feel it. You wanna feel the kneecap actually move and then you're gonna also push up. - Yeah, I'll see if they can get a different view this way. It's kind of hard 'cause my skid's moving all over. But you know, when I was a PT student, I had no idea that the kneecap moved this much. - Yeah. - If you, if your quads are completely relaxed, it really, you can really move your kneecap around quite a bit. - Well, and that's the problem is some of you who have this may not be able to move your kneecap very much.

But I have found out that with most people, if they just try and push the kneecap over and tape it over towards the other kneecap. - Mm-hmm. - And see if it feels better. Why not just try that first? Try the simple, the simple remedy first. - And this is for, for people at home this is what all you really can do. And if it works, it works. If it doesn't work, no harm. - Take it off, yeah. - No harm done. - Just a cost of a little bit of tape - Right. - And why not give it a try? So Brad, normally what we do is, and sometimes, you know like if you get a McConnell taping technique there's actually material or that wipes they can do beforehand. - Pre wipe, yep. - Because the skin can get very irritated with this taping. - Sure. - Some people are more predisposed... That was the other thing. This girl I had, she was keeping her tape on for a week and a trainer had told her to do this. - Sure. - Oh my God, I took it off. It was red. The skin had started to break down. - Yeah. - So nobody can keep tape on for a week. They all really recommend 24 hours. I've seen some go 48, but. - Mm-hmm. If you're allergic to it, you're probably gonna start turning red within a few hours. So if that happens, get the tape off right away. And this is not an option for you. Even if you're not allergic to it, you can build up kind of the allergy to it over, I mean. - Right. - A reaction to it over time because I've seen people that I've taped for weeks.

This is hypoallergenic and I'm not really doing anything with that. - Mm-hmm. - But the other piece of tape, what I'm doing is- - Sometimes I'll pull that a little bit. - I, I sometimes will. I usually do. - Now sometimes if, if you got, you know, someone with hairy legs, you might wanna shave but I'm, I'm not gonna shave my legs. - Yeah, he does that on his own personal time. (laughing) So what I do here now is I usually push the kneecap over. So I'm pushing it over towards the other knee. That's usually the direction you wanna try and I'll put the tape right on the edge of the kneecap. - Sure. - And I'll push it over and while I'm pushing it over I'll pull on the tape at the same time. - Yep. - And you actually might get a little wrinkled up in there in the skin and that's fine. - Yep. - And I usually like to do a double one, Brad. - Okay. I'll sometimes make mine a little bit longer just so it has more sticky and it has less apt to wrinkles. - I agree, I agree. It should go around here. And then sometimes I'll put some tape over the top of it to stop the edges from catching. - Yeah. - But again, I push over, I'm on the edge of the kneecap. I'm pushing pretty good on it, Brad. - Yep. - And then I pull and wrap it and the test, you know this is a good test. A lot of times, Brad, what we'll do Brad and I both will have somebody walk upstairs without the tape on. And they'll say, how bad was the pain? They'll say maybe it was a five out of 10. - Sure. - And then we put the tape on, we have 'em go up and down the stairs and we have 'em check it. And a lot of times the pain has decreased - Right, it may go down to as much as one or two or they say, oh, that's clearly better. Then you know, you're on the right track. "

I’m Mark and I’ll be doing your spirometry today. So, on this test we will ask you to exert yourself so I want you to be comfortable And we don’t want any clothing that is going to restrict your chest expansion or your performance. So, if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable. – Sure. And I’ll ask you to have a seat here. So, we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out but also, we are measuring how fast you can blow it out. We are trying to measure that maximum amount you can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouthpiece and put the nose clips on, I’ll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths and then at a certain point I’ll ask you to take a fast deep breath all the way in and I’ll tell you to blast it out and I want you to immediately blow it out as hard and as fast as you can and we have certain flow and volume criteria that we have to meet so even after you blow it out and you feel like you may be empty I’ll still coach you to keep blowing, keep pushing, keep going, keep going. And after a few seconds I’ll ask you to take another fast, deep breath back in and then I’ll ask you to come off the mouthpiece. So, let’s go ahead and try it. Go ahead and put the nose clips on; we want to be sure that you can’t breathe through your nose. And this mouthpiece is like a snorkeling mouthpiece so I need your lips over the outside portion of it and your teeth go behind it, teeth biting down on the two tabs. And just want to be sure your tongue is not including the hole in the mouthpiece. And just want you to begin with some normal breathing. All right, and now take a fast, deep breath in and blast it out! Keep blowing, keep blowing, keep going, you’re doing great! Keep going, keep pushing out, keep pushing, keep pushing. Take a fast, deep breath all the way back in. That’s great you can come off that mouth piece and take those nose clips off. As you can see, spirometry is an easy test to take. Talk to your provider about spirometry. "

If you have a knot, right here in your calf, usually if you have calf pain, if you palpate or feel in the muscle, you'll find a ropey tender spot where it's tight, it's tender, and that's what we have to roll out. We have to get in there and massage it with a deep massager, or you can use the roller, like this, and you could work on it, go over that. It's a little uncomfortable, but if you work with it, it can work out, and it's kind of one of those things that hurts, but it hurts so good because when you're done, it feels good. Now, the other option that we're gonna talk about "

Now this is the part, that as a therapist, we know that if we flex the knee, and we plantar flex the foot maximally, that's gonna shorten the calf muscles up maximally, and that's what we want. Now, the other trick is, you may have to take your foot, I'm gonna lower the knee so you could see it. Either evert it this way or invert it this way, and the way you know if you're in the right place, right position, is it feels best. So, in mine, because I don't have an injury it's hard to say, but I think I could feel a little best, now if you have an injury, you'll probably notice it. - [Bob] Yeah, you'll probably be able to tell immediately. - [Brad] If it's on the outside, it's probably, if you bring the foot towards that direction, but you experiment, see where it feels best. And once you find the spot, and then you're just going to hold and relax, then you have to time that for 90 seconds, pardon me, 90 seconds, and just relax. Breathe comfortably, relax. Make sure you clock it at 90 seconds, don't go less than that. It was real critical with the ... - [Bob] The timing is really important. - Right. If you're gonna hold it for 30 seconds, 45 seconds, it's not long enough for the muscles to relax. This is a neurological, this has been studied, and I'm not gonna go through the science of the neurological release, but it's all figured out. - [Bob] Sure. - And after that 90 seconds, you could go longer than 90 seconds if you want, then you're gonna just relax. - [Bob] Slowly. - Slowly. Yep, let it come down and then you can wiggle your ankle up and down. Everything's gentle, relaxed, you're not going to get into any of that aggressive, you're not gonna get the roller out. Although, there was another study, they combined rolling with- - [Bob] Along with this. - Yeah, and I don't know the protocol, but they said that was successful too, but again- - [Bob] We weren't sure if they did the rolling first, or the rolling- - No, I didn't read the article, but they said there's a combination. That'll come in time, Bob. - [Bob] And I would think that's what I would be doing "

Now, the muscle fibers go this way, so I'm gonna go right to left, and I work up and down. I'm gonna, usually even if you don't have a strain, you can find a tender spot right... - [Bob] So you're really not treating it right now, you're just looking for the painful spot? - [Brad] Right, trying to find the source of that- - [Bob] And you already have it on slack a little bit. - [Brad] Right. - [Bob] Because the knee's bent. - [Brad] Right. - [Bob] And a lot of people may not know that, but the calf muscle crosses over the knee. - [Brad] Right. - [Bob] One of them. - [Brad] One of them does, right. Plus, if you look at my ankle, it's plantar flexed, so I have the muscle on slack, and I'm looking for tender spot. - [Bob] That's more relaxing. - [Brad] Yeah, exactly. Good point Bob. And I can find one right there, it's kind of on the right hand side a little bit. It may be in the center, it may be here, it may be down in the soleus muscle, but you need to find it, and you will. Let's say I'm gonna go to this, I palpate it, right there it is. I'd give that about a three or a four when I work over it. - [Bob] Okay, on a scale zero to 10. - [Brad] Right. - [Bob] Or one to ten. - [Brad] Yep, so I'm gonna note that. Now, if you've got a real strain, you're probably gonna be up to around a seven or an eight when you hit that spot and push on it. - [Bob] So again, that's the level of irritation or pain. "

So do that about 3 times for 30 seconds, come down take a little break in between. And then if this gets easy, you can go into a prone push up. Where you're actually then coming up on your arms a little bit. Now see I'm still trying to keep my hips down and coming up like this. So it's not pushing up, but getting that bend in the back going into the extension trying to push that disc back in.

So like, if I'm getting symptoms all the way down here into the hand what I want to see is the hand gets better first. - Yep. - Now that could be numbness or tingling or burning or whatever, but, you know if you do the exercise, you go ah, there's a little bit less burning there. - Yep. - Just a little bit, I can feel it now. - Right, you really have to be, uh, aware of it before you start your stretch. I always have patients put a number for intensity on the pain and numbness in your hand and fingers right now, they'll say a six and we'll do some exercises, and sometimes they have to think about it. - Yeah. - Oh, that's down to a three now. So, or if it's getting worse from a six to a eight? Well then, we're going to stop that exercise. - That's a good point, Brad, because people forget. - Yeah. - And it may even, you know, not happen the first day. They might do the exercise for a couple of days and then they go, yeah, I can't remember if it's better or not, but if they go, it was a six and now it's only a three, I mean, so. - A good thing is sometimes it's like, oh yeah I forgot I even had it, where it goes back to normal. Your mind kind of forgets where it was. Uh, so writing it down on a calendar or a piece of paper is a really good idea. - This is a time, yeah, it's really good to chart. - Yeah. - So as it gets better, you're going to see the pain hopefully get, improve as you move up the arm. We actually have this tape so Brad can show improvement here. - Yep. Yeah, so Bob has these symptoms and he starts to stretch his neck in a certain way, and this is what happens the next day. The pain, the blue represents where the pain or the symptoms, numbness, tingling are. Let's say it gets this much better, all of a sudden. Oh, this part's gone but it still hurts here, and maybe even a little worse up here. That's actually a good sign 'cause it's getting better they call it distally or farther away from the neck. - Yeah. And, you know the thing is this could happen the same day even. - Oh, I've had it happen in the treatment room. - Yeah. So it might be a couple of days, it might be the same day. - Right. - Either way, you don't want it to get worse. - Yeah. We don't want it to come back. Let's say it gets better, but then the next day it returns. - Or the next day you do an exercise and it causes pain down here. - Yeah. That's a negative thing. We don't want that. - Right. So yeah let's say you're, you come in and you see me and you're like this. - Yep. - And we start doing exercises, and all of a sudden you have pain down here too. - Yeah. - That's the worst sign. - Yeah, then you gotta stop and change exercise, and that's what the therapist, that's our job is to get to the right exercise. It's just not a global thing. So let's say we do, we get to the right exercise and all of a sudden, well, oh, the arm pain is gone. - Yeah, the numbness, the tingling. - But it hurts a little more up here possibly. But the arm pain, the numbness, tingling is all gone. - Very good signs. - You bet. We're, I'm smiling as a therapist. - Yeah, now we're happy. - Yep. - It doesn't take much to make us, but this makes us happy. - And that's nice. A lot of people say ""I thought it was a bad sign because of my neck hurts, but the arm is better,"" and then you reassure them, oh, this is good. People relax and things start improve even more yet. Uh, do we want to continue? - Sure, let's continue. - Yep, you keep doing, a lot of times the same stretch, sometimes it has to be modified. Uh, and then the shoulder pain goes away and we just have a little bit here, and I'll have patients while they're doing the exercise, you know, they can feel the pain dissipate. - Go away. - Yep, uh, and you know, those are the easier ones, and out of all, not everything is this easy unfortunately. - Yeah. - It's when it, when it does happen, it's nice. It's kind of like the miracle in the clinic, you know. - Yeah, it's fun then. The patients think you're God. (laughs) - And then we continue, continue, and you know, when it comes down to it's just pain in the neck here, boy, and everything else is feeling good. That's a really good sign, you continue to work it and eventually - Boom, it's gone. - Yeah. Boom. Wow. "

Push down on the inhaler once. Now the medicine is inside the spacer. Right away, take a slow, deep breath. The goal is to not hear a whistling sound. If you do, this means that you're breathing in too fast. Hold your breath for a count of 10. Now, slowly breathe out. Rinse your mouth out with water, or brush teeth, or get a drink after using controller medicines, such as inhaled steroids. Many times, the correct dose of your medicine will be to inhale 2 puffs.

2844,How to relieve neck pain with a levator scapulae stretch? ,01:42,03:43,102,223,565,xYFeFFzFftw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYFeFFzFftw,"tension where it's that hurt so good feeling. so then the next stretch is going to be the levator scapulae stretch and that levator SCAP muscle is the one that elevates our lifts up our shoulder blades. and so a lot of times when we're holding stress, we overwork that muscle and it tightens and we kind of sit up in this position, and that can cause a lot of neck pain because that that muscle again goes all the way up into that cervical spine or that neck area and can put a lot of pain and stress on that area. so the way to stretch that one out is this one's going to be a little bit differently, so again you're going to use your arm but this time it's going to go up. so you can either just raise your arm, or I like to kind of put it back this way where my elbow is kind of pointing up towards the ceiling. so I'd be stretching this side now. so you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch and all this does is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down, and so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. so again if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're gonna get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. the important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down you're not bringing it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch but you're bringing it down kind of an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. so it's not down and then this way, it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. so elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up, and over behind the head. and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area, that levator scapulae muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. so again you're getting that nice stretch in there, holding it for 30 seconds, coming back up, three times on each side because if you're having neck pain, even if the neck pain is on one side, if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just gonna loosen up that whole neck area. so "
2845,How to relieve neck pain with chin tucks? ,05:49,07:31,349,451,565,xYFeFFzFftw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYFeFFzFftw,"the exercises. so one of my favorite exercises if you've seen some of my videos for neck pains is chin tucks. a chin tuck is really great because it's kind of a stretch and an exercise combined together, but it's a great way to help get you back in good posture. a lot of times with neck pain it comes from people like this either at their computer or if they're focusing on something they really bring that head forward, and that puts a lot of stress on the neck causing pain. so a chin tuck is super simple. you've probably seen in some of my videos where you use my finger as a target. you don't have to do that. the great thing about a chin tuck is you can do it anywhere, it is super easy. people might look at you a little funny when you're doing it, but it's easy to do. and so all you're doing is just like it sounds you're tucking your chin back and in, but it's not down towards your chest. so you're just taking your chin keeping it level, you want to keep your head level, you're not coming down or not coming up, but you're just bringing your head in almost you know if you have a wall or something behind you your chair behind you just try and push your head into the wall or the chair. and you see you have lots of little chins right there. and so you just want to hold that position. you might feel some tightness in the back, you might feel some tightness in the front as well, and hold that for about 3 to 5 seconds, and then relax. you can do those 5 times. you can do them several times throughout the day, but again you're just taking that chin tucking it in, and getting that you're working the muscles and you're stretching the muscles at the same time. so it's a really great exercise combination stretch to really kind of reset everything. and a lot of times just doing two or three you can already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position. your head's not forward so much, so I really like that exercise. and then the last one is just a another "
2846,How to relieve neck pain with isometric side bends? ,07:31,09:09,451,549,565,xYFeFFzFftw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYFeFFzFftw,"forward so much, so I really like that exercise. and then the last one is just a another super simple one that you can do all the time which is going to be an isometric exercise. a lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment or need something like a pop, doing an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well. so the one that I'm going to do for you today and and you can follow along with me is a side bent isometric exercise. but what isometric exercises are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle, so if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up. you can exercise it but you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right now. so the motion you're gonna be doing is this way. keeping your shoulders down your head going over, but your head's not actually gonna move. you're gonna place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area, and then you're just gonna push into your hands. so see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on this side. when you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. maybe do thirty to forty percent of as hard as you think you can push. so pushing over to the side this is the motion I'm doing but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side instead of do them all on one side. I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. so that 3 to 5 second hold maybe doing 5 on each side and that should really again not only help strengthen the muscle it might help get you back into alignment a little bit, and just get that neck pain out of there in general. so there you "

If they are coughing, encourage them to continue as they may be able to remove the obstruction. If they are unable to speak or cough they need your help straight away. If coughing doesn’t work, slap it out. Support their upper body with one hand and help them to bend forward. Use the heel of your other hand to give up to five sharp back blows between their shoulder blades. Then check to see if there’s anything in their mouth, if there is, tell them to pick it out. If back blows don’t work, try giving up to five abdominal thrusts. Squeeze it out. To give abdominal thrusts, stand behind them. Put your arms around them and link your hands between their tummy button and bottom of their chest. Clench your lower hand in a fist. Grasp your fist with your other hand and pull sharply inwards and upwards. Repeat up to 5 times. Check their mouth. If they are still choking call 999/112 for emergency help, use a speaker phone if you can. Keep repeating the 5 back blows and 5 abdominal thrusts until the blockage clears or help arrives. If they become unresponsive, open the airway and check their breathing. If they are not breathing normally, start CPR. So remember, if someone is choking: Cough it out "
