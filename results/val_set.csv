We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're gonna move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use  a hemostatic gauze or any gauze "

3024,How to apply a tourniquet properly to better find veins?,02:00,02:40,120,160,501,7lGE4OH0uJw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lGE4OH0uJw,"of multiple attempts. To increase the size  and the visibility of the peripheral veins,   we typically use a tourniquet. There are several  different kinds of tourniquet you can use,   but the idea with the tourniquet is that you  apply compression around the arm or the leg,   so that the arterial inflow continues, but the  venous outflow is prevented. So what that does,   it causes engorgement of the peripheral veins.  One better way to apply a tourniquet is to apply   a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it  at 90 millimeters of mercury, or something below   the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be enlarged  and better seen also by using several other   "

You can do several things  to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the   veins. The patient should immediately be warmed  up by application of bair hugger or forced air   warming devices, application of warm compresses  and things like that, but that really takes time.   "
3026,How to perform the reverse Esmarch technique to better find veins for injection?,03:51,08:10,231,490,501,7lGE4OH0uJw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lGE4OH0uJw,"instead, I will teach you a technique which  I call reverse Esmarch, that will allow you   to find IV access, draw blood or cannulate  veins even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the operating room  who is extremely cold, clammy extremities and   it's almost impossible to find a distal  peripheral vein. So what we're going to   do right now is actually we're going to use - you  can see there are a couple of attempts here - but   we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage,  and we're going to apply first a tourniquet,   and slowly move that tourniquet towards  the peripheral aspect of the extremity   while squeezing the blood consistently towards the  distal extremity. Here we go, we continue wrapping   the extremity, we stretch and apply, stretch  and apply, stretch and apply, until we get   to the distal extremity. And as we start assessing  the distal peripheral veins, we start tapping on   the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the  vasodilation because of the release of the   inflammatory mediators. The inflammatory mediators  then vasodilate the peripheral veins - here we can   clearly see a very nice peripheral vein that  is accessible now for cannulation, something   that previously we could not see. Now, here's  another very important trick that we always do,   is that is you want to bend that catheter, bend  that needle, because bending the needle allows   you to lift the needle up slightly, because  the angle of insertion has to be very low   as these are very peripheral veins. And here  we go, now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again another  patient who was brought to the operative area   where you can see multiple attempts at venous  puncture. An IV line that went on unsuccessfully.   So, we're going to then now proceed to  the placement on the other side here,   where you can also see a few punctures that went  on unsuccessfully. But the most important thing   here is that the arm stays down, never elevated,  because that would drain the blood from the   upper extremity. You want the arm to hang  down or be horizontal at least, and then   we apply that first round with the Esmarch  bandage which is for the tourniquet purposes,   and then we're going to squeeze the blood more  distally, so that the blood from the deep veins   actually pulls down and fills up  the small peripheral veins distally.   So here we go, stretch and apply, stretch  and apply, and keep going circularly for   this we typically use an Esmarch bandage that's  anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide.   We keep on going diligently, because  the diligence with which you apply   this Esmarch bandage is directly proportionate  with the success you're going to get   with this particular technique. As you can see,  we started seeing already some peripheral veins   of the dorsal of the wrist and the hand, but  typically the best veins that you get with   this technique are either on the dorsal side  or the volar side. Here we can see quite a few   of them now on the volar side, and again we tap  the territory several times because that tapping   releases inflammatory mediators. We stabilize the  skin, we stretch the skin, and if anyhow possible,   we pick the vein that has two contributors  because that's where the veins are fixed the best. Now the catheter enters into the vein,   we have an immediate flashback, and there you  go. Another successful intravenous placement. "

You can leave this one propped up if you want to. Pull your toes up towards you to help straighten out your leg. This is just going to be a straight leg raise, but you're going to do a hold at the top to help get that blood flow coming back down. So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood fo, flow, flow. So bring it up nice and slow, just to about even with the other side and hold it there for about 5-10 seconds.

You want to work your way up to a minute, even 2 minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also, if the circular motion is a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of pushing that way.

I'm tucking in my chin, and then I'm using that towel just to help get that little bit of a turn, little pause, come back in, and relax, and reset myself. so again you have to work a little bit at this to get the movement. sometimes it's hard to do all those combinations, but if you can get it right you're really going to get that stiffness out of there. so it works really really well. so the next one "

I like to alternate back and forth. you don't have to, you can do them all on one side, all on the other side, but I feel like when you alternate back and forth, you give the muscle a little time to relax and "

Yep right where there and this, you know, quite often a lot of headaches come from that too. - [Brad] Sure, sure. - And by massaging that area, which you can do with circles, Brad's gonna go ahead and show us some techniques here. - [Brad] Now, can you hear me Liz? 'Cause I got my mic-- - Liz cannot hear you so I will interpret, Brad. So he's gonna go ahead and so some circles, you can see again, he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah and he's in good posture while he's doing this. Now you can also do what we call a splaying massage, so he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this. Now this is something you can do, you know, anywhere. You probably can't do it driving because (Bob laughs) you've gotta have your hands on the wheel but you could certainly do this in the office or while you're watching TV, it's just a great one to do.

Bob's gonna use that strap there. - This is a stretch out strap. - If you're using a belt, a thinner one typically works a little bit better and now we're gonna start out, you can do chin tucks without this but I think when you use it, it kinda gives a little support and is helpful. So a chin tuck here, little support at the base of the neck, not up here. - The reason I like the strap sometimes is 'cause you actually can get to different levels of the neck. - You can get specific. - Yeah I can get real specific. I also, there's a way of doing the towel down here, you can also go up like this. - There you go, different angles. - Yeah, different angles and if the sets tend to go in that angle, so I can actually do chin tucks like this too and again, different levels of the neck. - And you're gonna go by how it feels. If it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. - I've seen it work both ways. You've convinced me more that it actually works almost better pulling down, Brad, for the majority of people but I have had some people that it works this way. - Now as you do this, the next step, now this is not number three, this is a continuation of number two. Get in a chair that has a back rest, so you can lean into it and then we're gonna start throwing some, we call it cervical extension or looking up with support. Then we find out, both Bob and I have found out that typically offers a lot of support and relief. You can go up like this, if that feels better or you can keep it down here and you're gonna go back as far as that feels comfortable. - What I saw, Brad, again and again is I'd first have people try it without a towel. - Sure! - I'd have them do this and they'd go, ""Oh that kind of hurts, ""that just doesn't feel that good."" - Yep. - So then we would go to the towel and they would take it home, they'd use the towel for a couple days and they'd come back and by then, they were almost ready to do it without the towel then. - Well yeah, even no towel pain, with a towel less pain, more range of motion but still not all the way. You know, we're looking for full extension. - Our end goal is that you can do it without the towel and you have yep, full motion. - Yep. - That's your end goal, however you get there. You might use a mix of towel and no towel. - Or you can use your hands, kind of like this. - You can use, your hands sometimes work too. - Yep, little tricks. Tricks that we'll show ya. "
3042,How can i relieve neck pain using neck rotation?,06:40,08:20,400,500,617,N59oOxyaE1A,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N59oOxyaE1A,"- It is. - You can actually rotate right to left and just give a little over pressure on your jaw. - Always really good posture on these by the way, you don't want your head forward like this and then working on rotation, that's actually not good for the neck. You wanna have really good posture, a lot of times, like you said, in an upright chair with a good back and then, yeah, you can give a little overpressure if you'd like, along on the jawline. - You know, I should've mentioned it earlier but just relax, breathing, deep breathing is very helpful in this. If going to the right is painful, don't go that way. Just go to the left or vice versa, go the pain free way and oftentimes that'll loosen up the painful way. Maybe not the first time but after a couple days or so and sometimes less. If you use a towel, now this is the tricky part. - This is the tricky part. - I'm gonna rotate to the right, so I'm gonna take my right hand, grab the left tail of the towel that's on the left shoulder. Up over the jaw and rotate, this might bump into my mic, so you might hear me scritch and scratch a little. Make sure you don't go like that. - Yeah, I often have you take it up to the eye, Brad. - Yep, sure. - You know, this one goes almost across the eye like this. - Yep. - And I'm trying to keep this shoulder from turning, so this left shoulder, I'm keeping it back. I'm not going like this along with the neck. Sometimes I even hook it around the chair, you know, the back of the chair. - Sure, that locks it in. It's amazing what this technique does, that the support around your low neck and the act, is that okay, Liz? Am I bumping into the mic? A little bit. Yeah, so I'm gonna cheat a little bit here, "

3055,How to perform a standing quadricep stretch for pain relief?,00:26,04:43,26,283,310,r21kAatSVqc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r21kAatSVqc,"link up there. so with the standing quad stretch, you can pretty much do this anywhere. you don't have to hold on to anything, but I always say it's best to hold on because then you can focus on your stretches just a little bit more. so with the quad stretch you really want to get in a good position. I'm gonna go ahead and have my timer getting ready to go, and I'll just explain as we go along, but it's gonna be 30 seconds stretches three on each side and we're gonna take a little 10-second rest break in between. so I'm gonna go ahead and start it and then we'll go along. so with the quad stretch standing, you're just gonna grab your foot and make sure the top part of your leg is straight down. so the important part of that stretch is that that quad is down. if it's here, you're not really gonna get a good stretch so you want it there and maybe even back just a little bit. the closer you can get your heel to the bottom your bottom, the better stretch you're gonna get. but you know I have to pull it all the way back just pull it until you feel a little stretch in there. and then take that little break in between. but again if your, if your thigh is coming forward, then you're no longer stretching your quad, so you really want to focus on that. so if you have to hold on a lot to be able to do that, that's fine. also the most important thing second to getting that that leg back there is not to lean forward because see you can be like well my legs back now, but if you're leaning forward, again you're taking away from that stretch, so keep your upper body nice and upright and just pull backwards. again you don't have to pull up as high as I do. I stretch every day, so I'm pretty flexible. so if you can only go to there that's okay, you just go until you feel a comfortable stretch. with that you can also add in a little bit more pushing back to get the hip flexors as well if you want. so if I'm stretching here and I pulled that knee back just a little bit more, I'm going to get those hip flexors stretching a little bit as well. so if you really want to get kind of a combination stretch, you can do that because that's a great area to stretch out if you're sitting, no falling, if you're sitting a lot throughout the day because those muscles are in a shortened position. so if you pull it back just a little bit, you're gonna get a combination stretch which is really good as well. there's a whole bunch of different ways to stretch out your quad, you can do it lying down, you can do it lying on your side, on your stomach, you can use a strap to stretch it out, but if you're at work and you don't really have equipment, this is the best way to stretch it out, and it's pretty easy to do especially if you work at a desk and you don't get to move a lot because you can just stand up at your desk. you don't have to go anywhere to stretch out. and so this is a good way just to keep those muscles moving especially if you don't get to move your legs throughout the day. because you don't want to get blood clots or DVT or anything like that. stretching out your legs is a great way to prevent all of that. so again just moving out stretching it out a little bit, getting that break in too, and then we've got one more on each side. so with the quad stretch, you should feel it right through here. some people feel it a little bit more in their knee, that could be because maybe that joint is tight as well. so if you're feeling it more in your knee versus in that quad muscle belly area, again maybe you can't go as high but try and bring that leg back just a little bit and that will should help get that muscle versus that knee joint because it's all connected. and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well, so if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching and there might be something else going on, and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles, there might actually something going on in there, and you really want to find out what's going on. so it shouldn't be painful. you should just feel tension with the stretch out your stretching through it.

3056,How to assess someone who has collapsed or is unconscious?,00:38,03:39,38,219,243,ea1RJUOiNfQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea1RJUOiNfQ,"So, when I see a casualty, first I’m going to check for any danger, to make sure it’s safe for me to approach them. I don’t want to become a casualty myself. Then I’m going to see if I can get any response from the casualty. As you approach, introduce yourself. Ask them questions to try to get a response. If they are not alert and do not respond to your voice, kneel down beside them and gently shake their shoulders 'Hello Amy, it's Winston, can you hear me? Open your eyes.' Still no response? You can pinch their ear lobe to see if they respond to pain. Depending on how the casualty responds to you will stablish a level of response. We use the AVPU scale and each letter can represent the casualty’s level of response. A – Alert, V- response to voice, P – response to pain and U – is the casualty unresponsive to any stimuli. If there’s still no response they are unresponsive and we need to check their airway. If the casualty is alert and speaking to you, you know that there is no problem with the airway. It is clear. If the casualty is unresponsive, open their airway by putting one hand on the forehead and gently tilting the head back with two fingers under the chin. Now we need to check to see if they are breathing normally. We do this by placing our ear and cheek over their nose and mouth, looking down the body to see if their chest rises and falls. We do this for 10 seconds. If the casualty is not breathing normally call for help. Ask them to call 999/112 for emergency help and bring an AED. If you are alone, call for emergency help using a mobile on speaker phone and begin CPR with chest compressions. The casualty is breathing normally, so I’m going to check their circulation. Are there any signs of severe bleeding? Look and check down the body. If you find severe bleeding, try to control the bleeding to prevent life-threatening shock. Call 999/112 for emergency help before continuing to treat the casualty. You may also need to treat them for shock. I’ve established that my casualty is not bleeding. So remember  to do a primary survey: Follow the order DR ABC. Complete each step, in that order, as quickly as possible, dealing with any life-threatening conditions as you find them. Call for emergency help – call 999/112. And that’s how we perform a primary survey. "

3071,How to strengthen the rotator cuff with a side lying internal rotation exercise?,05:34,06:51,334,411,826,s4wUKmr2xtA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4wUKmr2xtA,three times now you can also train your internal rotators so again the motions that the rotator cuff does would be external rotation and internal rotation we need to train both of those external rotations maybe a little bit more important but let's not forget about the internal rotators to train those internal rotators the exercise the dumbbell exercise that I like well let me back up I don't really like this exercise I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell you actually have to lay on your shoulder kind of creates a little bit of some pressure some impingement stuff in there while you're strengthening this it's not my favorite but if dumbbells are all you have it's better than nothing and so to demonstrate that let's go ahead and you're gonna lay down on your right side your elbow comes out in front of you just a little bit your elbow is bent to a 90 degree angle while you grab that freeway now what you're going to do is keep your elbow bent as you pull that free weight up towards the ceiling up nice and slow and then down nice and slow again not my favorite because you're laying on your shoulder but it's a resistive motion against that internal rotation range we're going up and we're going against gravity while we do it and as it becomes an effective way to train your internal rotators so external rotators and internal rotators those are two of my favorite Nobel exercises to hit those so my favorite way to train 
3072,How to strengthen the rotator cuff with a standing cable external rotation exercise?,06:51,10:30,411,630,826,s4wUKmr2xtA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4wUKmr2xtA,hit those so my favorite way to train the rotator cuff muscles are actually with these three exercises with your bands or with your cables that I want to show you right now now in the gym you can use a cable machine to set this up I'm here home we actually have these resistance bands at home probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them what I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video you can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have maybe pick up a pair of your own you won't regret it I love these exercises and so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal and external rotation and then I want to show you an extension exercise that I really like also now to demonstrate that let me show you what it's not first and so a lot of times when I see people doing this there's two mistakes that I see most often people will set up okay but then what they do is they let their elbow kind of migrate out to the side in this direction and then back down and so what this is we're not rotating the shoulder joint where this motion is called abduction we're abducting the shoulder shoulder joint we're working on the deltoid muscle not the rotator cuff and so what you need to do is keep your elbow tucked right in to your side now oftentimes what I'll see you can actually grab a towel to help you out with that and tuck that towel in to your side and so now as we rotate around that towel that's a little bit better the common error that I see with a towel is people don't make it thick enough naturally your shoulder joint isn't parallel to the floor it's actually angled up about 15 or 20 degrees and so that being said this position tucked right into my side isn't very natural for my shoulder you'll see that I can only rotate to about Oh 45 maybe 50 degrees there I should be able to take that through about 80 to 90 degrees of rotation so what I'm going to do let that stray from my side a little bit and now as I rotate you'll see that I can rotate even a lot further with it so don't be so concerned about pinning it down to your side what I tell people is you need to be more concerned about how that resistance is traveling start with the with the band right here at your bellybutton and then when you finish I want you to finish with your hand higher than your bellybutton okay so we start low and we finish high and what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotate is maintained as we get out to the side and so if your towel is too little it kind of pins your elbow into your side that's not a bad thing but we can make it better if we get the towel maybe kind of ball it up a little bit fatter you'll see that that's about all three or four inches now all of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it and so that's just a quick note on that towel the other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did I just straightened my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion so to show you how to do it correctly good posture okay so shoulders back head high chest high you're gonna go that band is right across it's just right above my belly button my elbows bent to a ninety degree and then as I pull against that resistance again elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher and so it looks just like this right here what you'll do is ten repetitions and you'll do that three sets I want you to fill that right in the back right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder so that's your exercise number

3099,What  do I do if someone is bleeding severely?,00:52,03:40,52,220,290,NxO5LvgqZe0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxO5LvgqZe0,"If the wound is covered by clothing, remove or cut the clothes to uncover the wound. Is there an object in the wound? If there is, don't pull it out because it may be acting as a plug to reduce the bleeding. Instead, leave it in and apply pressure on either side of it to push the edges together. If there is no object in the wound, apply direct pressure on the wound with your fingers and use a sterile dressing or clean non-fluffy pad to stop the bleeding. If you don't have a dressing, ask the casualty to apply direct pressure themselves to stop the bleeding. Jenny, can you apply some pressure for me please. Brilliant, excellent, well done. Ask a helper to call 999 or 112 for emergency help, or if you're on your own use a mobile on speakerphone so you can keep treating the casualty. Tell the emergency services where the bleeding is coming from and the amount of bleeding. The casualty may develop shock, so help them to lie down on a blanket or rug if there is one to protect them from the cold. Raise and support their legs so they are above the level of their heart. Do not raise the leg if it is injured. Jenny, can I lie you down? I'm just going to raise your legs up, is that OK? Secure the dressing with a bandage that is firm enough to maintain the pressure but doesn't cut off the circulation. I'm just going to apply this dressing to your bleed. Can you take your hand away? Can you hold that for me? Excellent. Check the circulation by pressing their nailbed or skin beyond the bandage for 5 seconds. Release the pressure. If the colour does not return within two seconds, the bandage is too tight. If blood shows through the dressing, don't remove it. Just apply a second bandage on top. If blood shows through both dressings, remove them, and apply fresh bandage ensuring there is direct pressure applied at the point of bleeding. Support the injured part with a sling or bandage, but check circulation every 10 minutes. Keep monitoring the casualty's level of response while waiting for help to arrive. "

So I’m going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing you can check on your crutches to see if there’s a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the hole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you’re going to turn the crutches right-side up and when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist so that your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there’s some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you’re using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads, because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation and the strength in your arms so that when you put your hands on the crutches, you do have a slight bend in your elbow and a slight gap underneath your armpits of about two finger-widths.

So you just work in the range that allows you. And then eventually, you might be able to go up this far. If you're still coming off like this, go up to the point where it allows you to go and stop right there and go back down again. - Again, this should not create pain, particularly sharp pain. If it does, skip it. - You might feel a little bit of discomfort when you first start that, Brad.

Exactly, that's a good point Brad. - Make sure you don't have tight jeans on though. - That's right. - You need something flexible. - The Zubas, remember the Zuba pants? - No. I don't get out much. - I betcha Mike knows those.

Yeah, I'm ahead of myself, there we go. So, here we're gonna bring the knee to the chest. You know, if you have a tight knee, you may have to grab underneath the knee and pull up. I know I've had a number of patients, they may have a knee problem, arthritic knee so it works well.

And look at what happens when he pulls on this one. You see how that one's coming up? That shows you that there's some tightness in there and he needs to stretch it a little bit. - Yep, now the other thing that you can do is bring this knee up and across to your chest and that gets a little bit of the piriformis, which is a muscle that goes to the hip and can be tight, so, make sure you get that too while you're working out. - Absolutely, all right, yeah, now you want "

What's nice about this one, this is a real easy one to do in your chair, also. You can just bring the leg up over across the other knee and you just go ahead and pressure on, pressure off, pressure on, pressure off. Now you can actually compare the two sides, too, and if one is tight, the knee is gonna be up higher and you know, that one you may want to focus and spend a little bit more time on it. If you know, it's just like the wayward child in your family, you might wanna spend a little more time on that and raising that one, so. - Were you the wayward child? - I was, yeah. - I could imagine how much time they had to spend with you. But you could do the same thing laying down. You know, here my knee goes to here and if you do the other leg and it only goes this far its probably the painful hip and that's the one you're going to spend a little more time on.

And when you're standing in with good posture, you wanna go ahead and put it underneath your arms, and let your arms hang down, the wrist should come about even with the handles here. - Right. So if they were like this, if they're lined up down here, these have to be moved as well, and these unfortunately do not adjust near as easily as the other height, but first how do we make sure that the height is right? - Yeah, let's go, that's a good point. Let's make sure the height is right first, you're gonna stand up real tall and maybe put the crutch just a little bit forward and you should be able to get two fingers width underneath his armpit there. - Yeah and actually right now these are touching my armpits, they're a little bit tall. - A little bit tall. - I could drop down an inch and I think I would be a little bit better, because you do not want these pushing into your armpits when you use the crutches. - Right and that's, I think a lot of people where they make the mistake, they think that they're leaning on the crutch and that's the last thing you want to do. You have nerves, arteries, and veins that are traveling underneath your armpit there. And you're gonna actually put pressure on them and you get numbness or tingling. And so you want to have that two fingers width underneath here when you're standing up straight. - I'm gonna drop these down and to try to see what it feels like. Oh yeah, yeah, that's definitely more like it. - Okay. So once you have the height set, then you wanna make sure the wrist is set, correct? - Yep. - So now you got that point, now you're gonna go ahead and see where your wrist falls. And again, his hits right along on the wrist where it's supposed to hit. When he puts his palm on there, you're gonna have a slight bend to the elbow. Right. That's that means that you've set them up right. - Right. - So you wanna make sure you got new grips on the bottom. I always like to test them a little bit, don't you Brad? - You bet. - I like to go like that and see that they're gonna stick. - Yeah, something I think there's a visual to see if they're worn through, because the aluminum rod can actually be sticking through. - For sure, wore smooth. - Yeah. - So and that's really it Brad, that's how to fit crutches, any other points?

3137,How to stretch the rhomboid muscles for upper back pain relief?,00:32,02:28,32,148,353,2AN6nO_3t8s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AN6nO_3t8s,"With the first part of the guide, we're going to focus on loosening up the muscles in the upper back. We're going to do that through stretching. I'm going to show you three easy movements. So with the first one, we're going to focus on a muscle group called the rhomboids. The rhomboids attach the spine to the shoulder blade region. They're responsible for bringing the shoulders backwards, so retracting the shoulders. How they get strained is from a lot of forward posture, so think using cell phones, sitting at the desk, and driving. It's a very common posture today and it's commonly known as tech neck, nerd neck, or text neck. So with this stretch what we're going to do is put our arms completely straight (we're going to keep the arm straight at the elbow) and then lock the knuckles together. The movement is drawing forward even more, so you can kind of see how my arms are just going forward, while I keep my hips and everything locked. What this does is it should feel like the shoulder blades in the back are starting to open and that muscle that connects from the spine to the shoulder blades is starting to get stretched a little bit. That would be the rhomboids. I like to hold this position for about fifteen to thirty seconds. I then come back to my starting position and then do it again for about three to five times. A good way to modify this stretch is to do an arc with it and what I mean by that is go back to this position right here and do that stretch... come back, but the next time that you do it go just a little bit lower and then do that same stretch (just like that) and then I just keep going lower with it until I'm all the way towards the floor. When you do this stretch you want your head to follow your hands all the way down. Why I like to do that is because it ends up hitting the upper back muscles just a little bit differently each time that you go down with it. "

That's that muscle that's right up here and kind of goes right up into the neck. That one is responsible for lifting the shoulders up. Again, if we're constantly leaning forward it's going to strain those muscles especially into the upper back and shoulder region. So this stretch is a two-part process. The first part, just lift the shoulders up. Shrug them up towards the ears as much as you can. The second part is bringing the shoulders backwards. This one you're trying to pinch the shoulder blades in the back. So again, shoulders up and then we're going to bring them back to try to pinch those shoulder blades in the back. It's just a really good one to be able to target that trapezius muscle. I like to hold this one 15 to 30 seconds, relax, and do about three to five times. "

This one is going to target all the upper back muscles (including the rhomboids and the trapezius muscles). It's really easy, so let's give this one a try.

So this would be the starting position, and then from there you're going to lean forward while bringing the elbows together. Then come back up and wing those elbows out, while you put the back into extension. You're trying to get a backwards bend, and that's the movement. What that's going to do is help open the upper back and reduce a lot of muscle tightness. Again, hold for about 15 to 30 seconds, relax, and then do it three to five times. "

We find that when you put it on an incline, this direction works really well right after that first week after surgery. For one thing, you're going downhill makes it easier. It changes the angle of the ankle joint, and for some reason, we're not 100% certain, but we always have better luck when you put it on an incline if someone's having problems. We have the patient go like this with their strong leg, put a little passive range. We always find that people get better range when they do the pressure versus the therapist going on there and pushing. - [Mike] Yeah, shoving it in there. "
