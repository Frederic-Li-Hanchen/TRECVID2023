"Carefully palpate the individual lymph node stations. To facilitate differentiation between lymph nodes and muscles, the area that is palpated should be as relaxed as possible. Every palpable lymph node is considered enlarged. If there is enlargement, pay attention to consistency, tenderness, mobility, the number of enlarged lymph nodes, and any erythema in the affected area

"Dr. Ellen Slawsby, an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, said that she has a bunch of tactics for controlling pain with both the mind and body combined. Like the meditators do, she said controlling your breathing might help a lot. It’s simple to do. Just sit down and take breaths and concentrate on those breaths. It’s just you and your breathing. It’s sometimes called “controlled-breathing.” The New York Times writes that this is an ancient practice and has been proven to not only help with pain but to also to increase alertness and boost a person’s immune system. Here’s a snippet from that story: “Consciously changing the way you breathe appears to send a signal to the brain to adjust the parasympathetic branch of the nervous system, which can slow heart rate and digestion and promote feelings of calm as well as the sympathetic system, which controls the release of stress hormones like cortisol.” It sounds crazy, but one doctor who was interviewed said he had seen some of his patients transformed by simply taking some time each day to breathe in, pause, breathe out. Ok, we know that if you didn’t do that all day you’d die, but we are talking about a kind of focused breathing here, not the unconscious kind.

"The experts tell us that mindfulness and positive thinking go a long way to helping reduce pain. People often think of the pain as a whole, like it’s all over them and it will never go away. What they should do is focus on the area of the pain and then try and understand what kind of pain it is, whether a burning sensation or a throbbing sensation or something else. They should then treat it with kindness as if they were nurturing a child in pain. Once you know the area of the pain you can also then concentrate on a part of your body that isn’t in pain. Try your hardest to focus all your attention on that area. Breathe in and breathe out, and see how long you can focus your thoughts on the non-painful part of the body. You could do this outside with the sun shining on you. You will feel the rays warm parts of your body. Focusing on other stimuli other than the pain helps manage the pain. If anything at all can distract you from your pain then look to that thing. You might try breathing exercises, but you might also just put yourself in a position where external stimulus takes your mind off the pain. You can practice the art of being distracted. Drug addicts in their numbers have talked about how just getting up and doing something helped them to deal with the pain of withdrawal.

"Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is a pinched nerve in the wrist. The nerve pinching is right here and you will actually get tinkling, burning, achiness, a deep boring type of pain in the thumb, the first finger, the second finger, the middle finger and half of the ring finger. Carpal tunnel syndrome will not give you numbness in the little finger. Very often sometimes if the nerve is pinched up a little higher or more proximal you will get a palm type of tinkling too. The symptoms will usually be from some type of repetitive motion, where you are typing or are sleeping in a funny position or you have a job where there is a lot of vibration to the wrist. In addition to this most of the time people complain about symptoms at night, because for some reason we are resting or are sleeping like this.

"Here I've used red marker to simulate a volar pulp injury and I will show you how to put the dressing on. So I used the IV 3000 dressing by Smith & Nephew because of its semi-porous capability it makes a nice wound dressing. I go ahead and take of the covering. I have the patient lift their finger up and place it down. I do not take it proximal to the PIP joint and this will enable the patient to move their finger afterward. So I've placed the IV 3000 down first and put their finger on it and then I take another IV 3000 and I will place this over the wound, again proximal to the PIP joint and I'll simply sandwich the IV 3000's together and then remove the tougher outer covering on the dressing. Once I have this removed it's very soft and I'll be able to fold this up and then cover with a band-aid and the patient can shower with this on. And I generally have them change it every three days at home. And you'll see after I put the band-aid on the patient will be able to move their finger. And it maintains the range motion which some of the flaps are unable to do.

"Clean the area where you will set out your supplies. Place a clean towel over the work area and open the packages of the supplies you will need. Place the supplies on the work surface. Clean tweezers and sissors with alcohol and place on the clean work area. Cut pieces of tape longer that the length and width of the wound to secure the dressing. Hang one side of the tape from the edge of a table or workspace until needed. Wash hands with soap and water if they are soiled or use a 60% alcohol-based hand gel before touching your wound or drain. Remove the old dressing and packing material by covering your hand with a plastic bag or a glove. Check for drainage or odor and discard the dressing and glove. Re-apply hand gel and put on clean gloves. Inspect the wound and check for any signs of infection such as redness, swelling and odor. Remove some packing material from the package with the tweezers and use scissors to cut the right length. Use a cotton swab to gently push the packing material into the wound and fill the wound's space. Leave a small tail of packing material out of the package and close the container. The next time you use the packing material you will cut of the tail and start with fresh material. Open the package of outer dressing material and place enough dressing over the packing and wound site to completely cover the wound and absorb the drainage.  Tape the outer dressing in place or wrap bandage to hold the dressing in place. Remove your gloves and place in the plastic waste bag with any old dressings that were removed.

"A simple test of this, what I want you guys to do is stand up right now. Just stand normal where you're at and put your thumbs forward. So stand up and put your thumbs forward and you can see that if I stand here - with you know relatively good posture - my thumbs are kinda angled towards you, they are angled towards that camera. That's where they should be, however you'll see that if I have poor posture, if I just cram my shoulders forwards slightly, now I point my thumbgs you can see that they are actually pointed at each other. Ok, so it's just a really quick simple test that you can do to diagnose where you are at in the posture spectrum.

"What you're going to do is grab your foam roller. This is probably my favorite piece of equipment that I have in my physical therapy clinic. We use this for quite a few problems. This is one of my favorite things to use with the foam roller is actually these postural issues. So this foam roller is thirty-six inches long and it's a six inch diameter. So it's a thirty-six by six. I'll actually leave a link to that up in the description to this video. Click on that if you don't have one. It's a great tool. It's something that I use all the time. And so what I want you to do with your foam roller is lay it down on the ground and then you're going to sit down on the end of it and lay it the length of your spine.So it's going all the way basicallyfrom your tailbone up to your head.What you should feel here is just a stretch throughout the front of the chest, front of the shoulders, as the shoulder blades kind of round down towards the ground. It's just a great way to get out of that forward, kind of rounded shoulders posture. Now, what I want you to do is simply grab a towel with both your hands and then you're going to take that towel up andover your head just as far as you can take it. Knuckles all the way down to the ground. If you can get there, I don't want any shoulder pain going on while you're doing this. And then, nice and slow, return back to that starting position. Now, in my clinic, what I'll do is I'll seta two minute timer, and this is the amount oftime that I want you to do this for. You're going to hold it over your head for about a ten second count and then return back down to your hips. Now, a towel works well. I've got some golf clubs in my clinic, so I use a golf club with this. You can also use a broom or a mop or a towel, whatever you might have lying around your house works well. Everyone has a towel and so that's why I use that in this video for this demonstration. Now, again, the idea here is that we want to lengthen out specifically that PEC minor and that PEC major. As we're coming up into this kind of externally rotated and elevated position. Again, we're going to get out of kind of this forward, rounded posture, and we're going to help to facilitate this type of emotion, getting back, opening up the chest, opening up the shoulders, getting back up into here.I love that foam roller for that.

"The other thing that I like to do on the foam roller, I call them angels. What you're going to do is you're going to leave your feet right where they're at. So nice wide base of support. And now what you'll do is you'll start with your hands at your sides, with your palms up, and then you're going to do basically a big kind of snow angel motion, a big jumping jack motion with your arms so nice and slow from your hips all the way up and over your head. Try to keep your knuckles down on the floor if you can. You're trying to, again, just really facilitate that opening of the chest opening of the shoulders with this one. Set a two minute timer on that one. And those are, I mean, just four minutes worth of two simple exercises that you can do on that foam roller.That really go a long way in helping to open up that posture.

"Now maybe you don't have a foam roller. What you can do are either some doorway stretches or some corner stretches. You can do them in a doorway. You can do them in a corner. Both are pretty effective. Let's show you what they look like in a doorway. What you're going to do is place your hands up nice and tall on either side of a doorframe. Take a step into the doorframe and then simply put your weight onto that front foot. What you'll notice here is again, we're in this extended, externally rotated position. That maximum stretch position for that PEC minor muscle. And then you're going to put your weight onto that front foot. Again, just to open up the PEC Minor, PEC Major, all through the shoulders, all through the top ofthe chest is where you should feel this. I actually like to do this in a couple of different locations. So I showed you up here, nice and tall. Now, what we'll do is we'll actually go to about mid range. So put your hands at about shoulder height and then repeat that same stretch. Try to step kind of through the door in that motion. And then you can also do this down with a low grip as well. So I'm going to put my hands down low, about waist height on either sides of that door frame, and then step through that door again and again. What you're going for here is that stretch through the front of the chest. Front of your shoulders. Try to keep it nice and comfortable. Hold it for about 20 seconds. Repeat that about three times. Again. We're getting out of this rounded shoulders posture backinto this kind of chest out, chest high position.That's where we want you to be. Now, let's show you how to strengthen and stabilize once you get there.

"All right, so we've addressed the stretching issue. Again. We want to stretch where it's tight. Now we need to address the strength issue. The goal is to strengthen where it's weak. To do that, I want to show you a couple of my favorite strengthening exercises. The goal here is to get the Rhomboids activated. Those are the muscles between the shoulder blades as well as those middle traps, as well as those external rotators. Basically everything that's going to pull you into this position right here, to suck the shoulder blades back and to keep you upright. And so to do that my favorite home exercise. Zero equipment required on this is going to be a wall angel. Okay, what I'm going to do, my feet come out from the wall just a little bit. You can't see that in the video here. But my feet are about six inches away from the wall. I want your hips, your shoulder blades, and the back of your head up against the wall. Again, the goal is to get into that perfect posture and then to strengthen and to stabilize right there. Hips, shoulder blades, back of thehead are against the wall. What I'm going to do is I'm going to externally rotate through my shoulders to get my knuckles to the wall as well. Now, for a lot of you, this might be really hard to do if you keep going on those stretches. And if you keep trying to do this, it does get easier with time. For those of us who can get there. I want to get my knuckles back to the wall. My elbows don't necessarily have to be to the wall. If they can be, that's even better, but not necessary. Knuckles are against the wall. And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to perform another one of those angel exercises, keeping my knuckles in contact with the wall the whole time. I'm going to slide them up and over my head until they touch up at the top and then nice and slow, back down. Now, on this one, what I'll do is I'll set a 1 minute to two minutes. So 60 seconds to two minute timer on this. And then just go up and down nice and slow at this pace right here. Really focusing on the posture, really focusing on squeezing those shoulder blades together in the back while you're going up and down. That's what my wall angel looks like. That's kind of the phase one exercise. As soon as that starts to get a little easier, let's show you what phase two looks like.

"Now, phase two is going to be the exact same motion. We'll just take it into an antigravity position. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your stomach with your arms stretched out over your head. Now what I want you to do is raise your chest up as high as you can. So roll your shoulders back, pull through yourback, pull your shoulders up towards the ceiling. That's, again, the posture that we want to strengthen in. And now just bring your elbows down to yoursides and then back up over your head. We're going from a position of doing a dive up above your head. With your arms together, pull down through your back to a position of a big W through your arms.Again, what we're doing here is we're taking that same strength and position, that nice, good posture that we want to stabilize in, and we're making it an antigravity motion. So those muscles through your rhomboids, throughyour middle traps, those external rotators. They have to work even harder as you're going through this motion antigravity. So again, that's kind of phase two. When the wall angels become a little bit easier, try it down on the floor. Try to do some of those angels down on the ground and see how that works. You guys are going to love that. It's a tough exercise, but I know it's effective. All right, you guys. So there you have them. Five great exercises that you can do to fix your poor posture.
