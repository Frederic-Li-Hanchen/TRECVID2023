1,How to perform epley maneuver for vertigo?,00:12,01:48,12,108,121,lbPbM8018CE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbPbM8018CE,so what you're going to do is you're going to take the patient and you're going to turn their head 45 degrees towards the side that was triggered 20 degrees extension you'll have them hold your arm again and the difference between the dick Saul pike and the Epley maneuver is a couple things we're actually going to bring them down much more quickly to help jar those crystals loose out of the canal the other important piece of information is we want to be able to maintain that position for at least 30 seconds or until the symptoms start to dissipate so on the count of three we're gonna bring you down really quick 1 2 3 now with this mistake that therapists make is they will actually maintain the position for 30 seconds but the patient will still have symptoms you want to make sure that you stay in this position at least 30 seconds but if after 30 seconds they still have spinning you want to maintain that position until that starts to go away and then you're actually the second position is going to be turning their head rapidly to the opposite side on the count of 3 1 2 3 and then 30 seconds later go ahead and bend your right knee and then roll over onto your left side and you'll tilt their head down towards their left shoulder and 30 seconds later you'll have them sit up on the edge of the bed and maintain their head tilted towards that left side and 30 seconds later 
2,How to loosen up the calf muscles using a metal spoon and lubrication for instant calf tightness relief?,01:36,04:32,96,272,775,PoSgyRG27-E,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoSgyRG27-E,"part of the spoon you take. I find that using the handle is a little bit easier but you can use the rounded portion here. Actually, experiment with it. Take what is most effective but what I'm going to do is start at the bottom of the leg, right at the ankle and when you do this, make sure to only go over soft tissue. Muscle that you can grab onto, skin, stay off any bony spots like this because that can cause irritation and we definitely don't want that. So, I'm going to take my spoon and I'm going to use the handle right here and put it in about a thirty-degree angle and I'm going to press into the point there's enough pressure that once I start to scrape upwards like this, it will feel like a nice self massage. We don't want this to cause discomfort. So, if it does back off a little bit, only go to your comfort level but just work your way up. When you do this, you want to go bottom to the top. And you want to do about five to ten slow repetitions in each spot and then once you're done with that, just switch over to a different spot and repeat. You want to go front to back and pretty much just target those spots. When you do this all you might find that one certain spot just feels very gritty, almost like sandpaper. That's a spot of adhesion and you want to make note of that. That's usually a spot that's causing tightness and possibly pain and you want to break that up. When you do this also, you might notice that pockets of redness form on the top of the skin. That is completely normal. That's blood flow coming into the area which is good. It's improving circulation and bringing in blood to hopefully promote healing but once you're done with that, really try to focus on the front here on the shin. Shin pain is very common so really attack that but work your way up into the calf all the way up to the knee front and back when you're done with that you can definitely use different parts of the spoon, you know dig in there and experiment with it. You can also attack it at different angles so instead of going up with it go at 45° forward and then go 45° backwards, take whatever you feel is working the best and any spots that feel like they're, you know, locked up, tight throw more repetitions in there to break up that muscle tightness that spasm whatever you might have. Once we're done with that, let's throw some motion into that calf muscle to challenge it to open up new spots that might be causing pain or discomfort. So, what I like to do is press from my heel into the floor and then, I'm going to just take my toes upwards towards the ceiling. What this will do is activate that calf muscle. So, again, start to go over that and you may find that new spots of tightness have formed or new spots of pain can be targeted. So, really dig in there and try to loosen that up I also like to do a little bit more ankle motion so what I'm going to do is turn my ankle inward repeat that and then once I'm done with that I'm going to turn my ankle outwards and then repeat that also because this just activates that calf muscle just a little bit differently but go through all of those motions go through all of the areas target spots of adhesion or any spots that you feel are tight and achy, try to loosen that up and I hope that that gives you a lot of quick calf pain relief.

We're going to start off on all fours on the floor just like this from there what I'm going to do is go into kind of like a push up position I'm going to put my feet out like this my weight is going to be placed on my toes whatever side that we're focusing on let's say that I have a little bit more off to my right I'm going to lift my left leg up, keep my right leg straight, and then just place my foot over the calf muscle on the right side just like this. What I want to do from there is a rocking motion. So, I'm going to rock forward that is with my whole body is one complete movement rocking forward by driving through my toes. When you do this, you're going to feel the muscles into that calf really start to fire. Really focus on that as much as you can. You want to feel it into the calves but hold this position for about three to five seconds. From there, you're going to try to then take the heel towards the floor. Press with your hands right here too to lower your heel down even further and it is a deep stretch into that calf muscle. Again, hold three to 5 seconds, only to your comfort level. From there, just do this for about fifteen complete repetitions. With each repetition, always challenge yourself to go forward and then backwards even more. It'll help engage those muscles even more to hopefully give you more pain relief and when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. So, here is a great "

What I'm going to do is start off in a scissored stance like this. Whatever side that we're focusing on. In this case, I'm having right calf pain. I want to place that one forward and then I'm going to put my toes on the door and then lower my heel down into the floor for stable anchor point when you do this too you also want to bring the toes back towards you or raise them up on the door as much as possible. Build an initial stretch into that calf muscle. You want an initial stretch to begin with. You'll get better results with this. You can then take a hand whatever side you want. Grab on to the doorknob if you need to for extra stability but what I want to do is keep this knee straight, the side that we're focusing on. The other one can go bent. I'm gonna use this back leg right here to push forward with my body weight. So, I'm kinda lifting off like this and pressing my body towards that door of the wall. The more that you do this, go forward, the more intense the stretch is going to be felt into the calves. Only go to your comfort level. Hold this comfortably for twenty seconds. From there, relax, take a breather, and then repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, try to drive your body weight forward even more. Because it will only help stretch those calves out and hopefully lead to more pain and tightness relief. If you want to take this one to the next level, what you can do is stretch into it but then pull forward even more with the doorknob. So, I'm using my hand right here at the doorknob to pull myself forward even more and this can become extremely intense of a stretch. So, again, only to your comfort level. If you want to take this one even to the next level, move over to the door frame right here. Open the door, grab of that door frame and pull yourself forward even more but again, only to your comfort level.

5,How to strengthen the calf muscles using a yoga block to get relief from calf muscle pain?,08:33,11:15,513,675,775,PoSgyRG27-E,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoSgyRG27-E,"you can use a stack of hard cover books or just a block of wood. I call this the calf smashing circuit and if your calf had a butt, this would kick it. So, I'm going to step up onto that stair or that yoga block to the point where my heels are going to be off, my toes are going to be on. If you are in a staircase, just take your hands, grab off to the side right here on those walls for support. If you are doing it next to a wall, just grab onto it like this. What I'm gonna do first is a simple calf raise. That is just lid up with my feet trying to take my heels up towards the ceiling. Try to focus on feeling and activating those calf muscles through all of these exercises. You should really feel it into the calves. So, what you want to do is go to a comfortable point of activation of those muscles. Hold this for five seconds. From there, come back down, relax, take a breather, and then repeat this up to ten times. With each repetition, really focus on driving up even more to challenge yourself to help strengthen those muscles. From the we want to do the opposite. So, let's go all the way up and then do a heel drop. That is just slowly coming down to the point where my heels are going down towards the floor. Do let them touch the floor though. Just let them hover. This should take you about 5 seconds from going to the top all the way down to the bottom and really fight gravity and your body weight. What you want to do for this one is ten complete repetitions. If this becomes too easy, what you can do from there is just take one leg off and then repeat those exercises. It'll become more challenging because you have more body weight to deal with. Once you're done with that, what we want is to focus on more dynamic movements. Challenge those muscles through different motions. What I'm going to do is what is called an eccentric calf raise. So, I'm going to tilt my body just a little bit towards one direction. In this case, my right, and then I'm going to repeat that calf raise. When you do this, you'll notice that the muscles get hit just a little bit differently. And you want to repeat this one again for five second holds for ten repetitions. From there, go all the way towards the left and repeat. Experiment with different angles. If one feels very weak, like, let's say when I go to my right, it just feels very weak compared to the left. I make note of that and I throw more repetitions in to help strengthen those muscles to hopefully again future proof them from pain and tightness. You can also do circular motions like this but you just wanna do that and then from there, switch to doing the heel drops and do that same motion all the way towards the left, go down a little bit, and then go all the way towards the right and focus on any motions with that heel drop that feel a little bit more weak and if it does feel like it's too easy, just take one leg off and repeat this. But whatever you do on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. So, if you stuck "

Let's lay it flat on our back. Put our head down like this. What I'm going to do from here is raise my heels up towards the ceiling as much as I can and drive my leg weight into my toes into the floor for a stable anchor point. From there, hands go on the hip and I'm going to lift my butt up towards the ceiling as much as I can. You want to pretty much have your knees to the hips to the shoulders in a nice straight line. Really focus on feeling into the calf muscles. If it doesn't feel like it's really activating them, what you need to do is lift the heels up even more until you feel it. Once we hit that very comfortable activation of the muscles and I'm telling you what, it activates a lot of muscles in this exercise. Let's hold this for five seconds. From there, relax, take a breather, and then repeat this one up to ten times with each repetition. Drive the heels up towards the ceiling, lift the butt up even more to challenge those muscles to hopefully strengthen everything. Again future proof things from pain and tightness if this becomes too easy you can take one leg off like this and repeat and it becomes extremely challenging so try that one and remember whatever you do on one side "

This is, I find with some people, because arthritis tends to flare up and it tends to calm down, a lot of times, by using the cane, it tends to calm down faster. - Because you're taking weight off, it's not irritated as much. - Right. And so, we're not telling you that you're going to use it permanently. - Right. - And we're not even saying that you have to do it everywhere. If you don't feel like you want to do it in public, just do it in your home for a while. - Great, limp instead. (laughs) - Yeah, limp instead, which people think they look better when they're limping than using a cane. - Right. So if you got to, you know, get a cane, you adjust it so it's about at wrist level and you're standing tall. If it's your right hip, you use it in your left hand. That's one thing that a lot of people get confused, and just walk normal. When the right leg goes forward, the cane goes down, taking weight off the painful hip. "

So, you go up to your stairway. We don't have a stairway here. - Yeah this is a great way to start getting some movement in the hip. - Yep. - Without hurting yourself. - Right. So, my right side is the painful hip. So I'm going to go up with my left, you're going to have to hang on to the handrail. In this case, I'm going to use my Booyah Stik for balance, because you need something for balance, for most people. Now, I'm going to let this leg, the sore leg, completely relax, like all the muscles are jello, and I'm just going to gently swing it forward and backwards; and the reason you want the hip to relax, is the weight of your leg, through relaxed muscles, is going to distract, or pull the joint apart slightly, so you don't have that bone on bone. - A little bit of traction. - Right, you get a synovial fluid. If that's working out great, you may want to put a little weight on. You can use an ankle weight. Now, I've had people just put their winter boots on, up here in the North world, you know. - Oh, that's a good idea. - You know, a boot usually weighs a pound or two, at least. - Nice! - And, you don't have to go out and buy anything, and then, your leg, your hip doesn't know if you've got a boot on or an ankle weight. And, you know, do the same thing, you got to swing it for a minute or two, and I find people have success with that. It's pretty much a temporary thing, but it reduces things. It's a good way to treat it. - Safety first and it starts getting some movement in the hip, which you may not have had for a while, because it's been sore. - Right. "

You can do it sort of laying in bed, and that's what we recommend. - Yeah, wake up and... - You could do it on the floor, but then you got to get on the floor. It works just as good in bed, and you know, simply lay like this, and then you're going to see how far you can bring your knee up and to your chest. Now, if you can bring this knee all the way up like this, and this one you get about this far, and all of a sudden, oh it hurts, or there's a, we call a hard end tail, doesn't want to go any farther, that's the knee, or that's the hip, you're going to want to work on. So, and I am doing it with the right hip. Let's say this one goes way up to here, and this one stops here and it's tight, and it's a little painful, but if you stretch on it, oh good to relax, and after about 10 repetitions you notice the hip is starting to go up farther, similar to the other leg, then you're going to want to do that stretch, well, at least once a day, but I'm going to suggest two or three times a day, assuming it doesn't get real sore from the stretch. The first couple times you stretch it, you may want to give it, you know, wait until the next day. - [Bob] And I wouldn't expect that it would react that fast. It may take weeks or even months before you start to equal the other one again. - Sure, right. - [Bob] That's a tough fibrous material that is holding the hip together, in the socket, holding the hip in the socket. So, it's not always that easy to stretch. "
30,How to externally rotate the hip for pain relief from arthritis?,06:56,08:32,416,512,727,6GzDzV1wBOs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GzDzV1wBOs,"- And so, along with that, what you may want to check what we call the external rotation of the hip, and I'm going to go this way so you can see what I'm doing. So, with this leg, I'm going to go over the top of the knee like this, and I'm going to let the knee drop this way. So, you can see, I can go this far, and the hip that has the pain may only go this far, as oppose to like this, like the other leg. So here, all we're doing is gently push the knee, and relax, pressure on, pressure off. And if it feels good to keep the pressure on, you may use that option and hold it 15 to 30 seconds, and not do it maybe as repetitions. But don't, number one thing you don't want to do, is spend 20 minutes stretching your hip. 10 repetitions on and off, or three times 15 to 30 seconds is probably a good place to start. - [Bob] And what's nice about that one, you actually can do that one seated too. - Oh, right. - Brad's going to actually show how to do hip flexion the other way too. You can actually just cross the knee, cross the ankle over the opposite knee, and you can go ahead and just push down like this and give it a bit of a stretch. A lot of people tell me, that last patient that I had that had hip arthritis, they can't even get that leg up there. - Yeah. - That's how tight it's become. - Sure. - So, they might even have to start with the knee down, like this, a little lower, and press it down. But, they know right away what I'm talking about, because, like you said, they can maybe get the one up there, but the other one, ""I can't get that up there."" - Right. - So, it's a great stretch. "

The next one, now this is for people probably more mobile. They got hip pain and they got fairly good balance. You see, you can go up to a stairwell or, in this case, a stool, but I'm going to stretch my right hip. I'm going to come up to here and I'm going to go like this, and what's going on is my hip is flexing. You see how my knee is coming towards my chest? So, that's a lot of hip flexion and it drops in. You know, this has got to assume you have a good knee too. But it will stretch your knee if you need some working on that. You get two joints at once. - The stairs work great for this, Brad, because I've had even really quite elderly people able to do this one, because they start off on this first step. - Yep. - You know, they start there, and a lot of times there's two railings. - Right. So they got to hold on. - Yeah, they got to hang on to and I have found most people can do that. If they can climb stairs, they can usually do this stretch. - Yep, as long as there's hand railings. - Yep. So, it's a fantastic stretch. - Now, I do mine way up like this. Of course, I'm younger and I'm... But, it really helps I've got a side joint from. So, you know, this is not only just doing the hip, it could be, you know, work the nether muscles in the joint as well. - Well, what's nice is he's actually stretching the hip flexor on the opposite side. - Right. - So, you're actually getting two stretches in one here. - You can see it better here. You're getting this muscle and you're getting this bright. - Which also helps hip pain. You're getting a double bonus there. - There you go. - A great stretch to do it. "

And you can just work on that area and stretch it out. - If you're doing a roll or don't do it on your bed you can see on the soft cushion, it doesn't work well you know, on the floor works a lot better with the exception of this next one, you could do this. I never get on that thing. Well, so then you turn, if you've got a three foam roll or you turn it this way, right down your spine especially if you got the one that the lower density it's it's more comfortable.

As a matter of fact, you can do baby chin tucks while you're just relaxed and you're going to relax or you know, for five or 10 minutes - and straighten out your entire posture here, it's it's straightening out that upper back, lower back. It's stretching out your pecs. So it's an easy one to do in a relaxed position your head by a bale to get all the way back to start off.

What happened to all my ...? - Right here. I wonder you can take a towel roll and what we're going to do. I got a towel rolled up. This is how a lot of times I have patients start. As I mentioned earlier in the video, if you can't go back like this and it hurts, - This is a Mackenzie exercise by the way, Robin McKenzie developed it. - Yeah. You take a tall roll and go back in your chair good pasture and gently go back like this. And oftentimes I say, Oh, that's a part there it feels better. And I can go back farther. And then you gently work that, you know, five maybe 10 repetitions. Then you're going to take a break and then come back at it in an hour. So if your arm and your hand is feeling better it's a really good sign. If you start to do this and it starts to hurt worst on the arm that means you're pinching the nerve a little bit harder. And then you have to go to the next option. - Now Brad was saying that the towel helps better than no towel, - Right. If you just try these, if you can do these without the towel going with the towel, Oh - I've had people that have success just by putting their hands back with your fingers down - give it some support - low on in neck. And then you don't even have to use that towel. It gets similar results. And that depends on the situation and the individual you can use what which can work well is just the edge of a towel. So instead of a thick towel, we get more specific. - The salvage. - Yep The edge of the towel or the salvage I'm going to get low on the neck. You can kind of adjust it. - And yeah, that's the advantage of using the salvage is you can really get focused in on one area of the spine, - Right where that nerve is. It will do the same thing, and we can roll up a - And pull up towards the eyes if you want to. - I've had people do it this way and this way and whichever way works better feels better. It gives you more range. - Often I might recommend is grabbing it with one hand. Like if you have a painful arm grabbed with a non painful arm and just do one hand because it's just going to be a more comfortable. - Yeah, cause with the injured, the arm that sore it could even irritate it so you can relax it "

I'm trying to rotate my hip and that's an external hip rotation. even though my foots coming inwards, it's externally rotating my hip. so again you know 10 to 15 make sure you're doing both sides for that. so then the next one we're going to start using a resistive band. so if you "

If possible try to lie them down on a rug or blanket, as this will help protect them from the cold. Raise and support their legs above the level of their heart as this will increase blood flow to the head and vital organs, but if the casualty has an injured leg do not raise it. If the casualty is pregnant help them to lie with their body leaning towards their left side to prevent the obstruction of the blood flow returning to the heart. If you haven't done so already call 999 or 112, and tell ambulance control that you suspect shock. Once you have called for emergency help, you can then loosen any tight clothing around their neck chest and waist. Stay with the casualty and keep them warm by covering them with a blanket or coats. Try to reassure them and keep them calm. Keep monitoring their level of response. If they become unresponsive, open the airway check their breathing and be prepared to treat someone who is unresponsive. "

So our first stretch involves you getting  your heel really close to the wall and your toe   up right against the wall. So get your heel in as  close as you can, so that you're stretching the   muscles down through the calf and into the arch  of your foot. That includes the plantar fascia. So   bring your body now up, bring your hips close, and  if you can, bring your pelvis forward or your hips   close to the wall, and come up on the back toe to  increase that stretch. Some of you will need to   start with the foot down flat, but to increase the  stretch, come in close and hold it. Now, push down   through your heel, and make sure that your knee is  straight to get that deep stretch into your calf   and you might even feel it into the arch of your  foot. Hold it there, try to relax your breathing,   and ideally you're holding that stretch for 30  seconds at a time. And let's take it back down. "

We're going to bring the heel in close   to the wall, but turn the toe outwards.  All right. So the toes turned out. Now,   keeping the legs straight, turn your body around,  I’m going to come up on the back toe to increase   the stretch, turn your body right around to the  other side. Now, this is how you stretch the   outside part of that calf, so we're being really  specific while we're stretching in the calf,   outside part of the calf and the arch turn  your body away, push down through your heel,   and hold that stretch. Now, I can feel a  strong stretch through the outside part   of my calf muscle going right down into  the heel, and releasing slowly. Remember,   these stretches shouldn't cause you any  discomfort, just a feeling of stretching is   enough. If you're feeling that the stretches  are too intense, back them off a little bit. Other side, this time turn the toe inwards, so  stretching the inside part of the calf, so the toe   turns inwards. Again, this time bringing your hips  forward towards the wall, keep your knees straight   and turn your body around. I’m turning around to  face you now, with my toe turned inwards. Again,   keeping the legs straight, pushing down  through the heel, maintaining that stretch,   relax your breathing, keep holding the  stretch, keep holding, relaxing the breathing,   and coming down out of the stretch. So depending  on where, which part of the calf is the tightest,   you'll feel the most stretch, it might be the  outside part of the calf or the inside part. "

Again, take your heel in as  close to the wall as you can, bring your body up,   and now bend that knee in towards the wall, and  I can feel a really strong stretch down into my   Achilles tendon, and that's continuous through  that plantar fascia that runs up underneath the   arch of the foot and into the ball of the foot.  Again, pushing down, push your knee forwards   as close to the wall as you can. Keep pushing  and holding and ease off slowly. Now, ideally,   you'd be holding each of those stretches for at  least 30 seconds, maybe more if you've got the   time to, and repeating them a couple of times  each, maybe two or three times throughout the   day. When you start out, start out really gently,  because the muscles are likely to be really tight,   so just start gently and do what feels  comfortable. Some people find that they   stretch best when their muscles are already warm,  so you might have been for a five-minute walk,   and then do your stretches after that.

In this case, I found two cabinets of level height. You can substitute this by using chairs. Just put two sturdy chairs on the sides right here that you're able to grab on to. With this stretch, it's pretty straightforward. Grab on to the two ends, and stand up on your toes (right on your tippy-toes). Then drop your weight and support yourself with your arms. Just let the weight drop as much as you can. You don't want to engage the core muscles or the low back. You want everything to relax, that way the pressure is being taken straight down. Again, tippy-toes and let the weight drop. What this is doing is letting gravity pull on the back, releasing that pressure within the disc. At that point, un-pinching the nerve. What I like to do with this is hold it for as long as you can. 15 to  30 seconds is a really good starting point. If you feel like you can't support yourself, build into it with your comfort level and do it as much as you can. You want to do this a couple times throughout the day, to help decompress the back itself. Another variation of this stretch would be to sit in a sturdy chair with two arms. Then go right to the edge of the chair, put your feet out and then simply lift yourself up while putting the bottom weight on your heels. With this one (again), just let everything relax in the core and the low back. Just let gravity take the weight down to help open up the joint spaces in the back, relieving pressure off the spinal discs. Again, what I'm doing is lifting myself up (like this), putting the weight on my heels and relaxing everything and letting gravity take it. Hold this for 15 to 30 seconds, if you're able to. Relax for a little bit in-between and do it upwards of 3 to 5 times. You can do this stretch throughout the day, as long as you're seeing relief with it. "

You just need a level surface such as a mattress, couch, or counter top. Anything that's going to be close to hip level. You're also going to want a pillow for comfort. To start with, put the pillow at the edge and lie on it with our upper body weight. Let the lower body weight be taken down with gravity. Use your toes to stabilize yourself, and let everything relax. Hold this position for 15 to 30 seconds, if you feel like you're able to hold it for longer, you're more than welcome to especially if you're feeling relief. With this one, do it about 3 to 5 times with a little bit of a break in-between. "

What you're going to do is sit at the edge of the chair and then take the affected side (that leg) and then go all the way straight with it. You're going to really feel it pull on the back of the leg, the calf, possibly all the way into the foot. What we're going to do for the first part is bring the toes back towards us. The more that you bring them back towards you the more it's going to intensify that whole sciatic pathway. What we're trying to do is release tension. I like to hold this one for about 10 to 15 seconds. I then relax and you can bring your leg down (if you need to), I mean take a breather if you need it, and you're just gonna keep repeating that. I like to do it upwards to five times. So for the second part of this stretch we're going to go back into that same position with the toes back towards us but now we're going to use our upper body weight to lean into it so just kind of take the chin lean forward and that is really going to intensify that stretch. Only go to your comfort level. If you feel a lightning bolt going down your leg, back off a little bit. Let pain be your guide, go to where you feel comfortable. Again this is the stretch, bring the leg up. We're going bring the toes back towards us, we're going to hold that for 15 seconds, relax, repeat it three to five times and then for the second part we're going to bring the leg back up and then lean into it to intensify that stretch. It just takes a lot of tension off that sciatic nerve pathway. Give it a try! "

The more that you lean into it the more tension is going to be relieved off the back, butt, and back of the legs. I'll show you what I mean. So what I'd like to do with this one is hold for about 15 seconds, 30 if you're able to. Relax, do it about three to five times. Only go to where you feel comfortable, do not overdo it. "

After you do the rotation side to side, then you're going to do a side bending. With the side bending, you're taking your ear towards your shoulder, but you're not bringing your shoulder up to your ear. You want to keep your shoulders down and relaxed and then just side bend over trying to touch that ear to your shoulder, and again just hold it for about three to five seconds, and then come back to the other side. Try and keep your head in a fairly neutral position. Sometimes people kind of go down like that, but then you're just changing the muscle that you're that you're working and stretching, so try and keep that head fairly forward when you side bend, so again just about five on each side just to get it loosened up.

So again you want to keep your head level and you want to just push that chin backward, so you're making a whole lot of little chins there, but I like using my finger as a target because then you can kind of see how much of a stretch you get. So hold it for about five seconds here, and then come back and you can see that now there's a little space between my fingers which means I'm I'm working those muscles out a little bit, so that forward head movement that you might have then straightens back up.

So now that you got all of those muscles warmed up a little bit, you're going to go into some stretches. So now you're going to do an upper trap stretch which is those muscles in the back up there. Those ones that are on the top of that diamond, and what they do is hold everything together so they get stressed out a lot, and they have a lot of tension in them. So if you want to stretch the right side, you're going to put your right hand underneath your bottom, and what that does is it just kind of sets that shoulder and stabilizes it so it doesn't come up while you stretch. So just kind of sitting on that arm there, take the other hand and then just gently pull your head towards the side. Again you want to keep that head in that kind of neutral position. You don't want to turn your head you want to keep it upright and then just side bend over towards the other side. So for this you want to hold that stretch for 30 seconds, and then do that three times, but if you want to alternate back and forth, then you can give one side a break.

159,How to treat neck pain by performing levator scapulae stretches?,03:34,04:54,214,294,502,Rvv8pOEADYo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rvv8pOEADYo,"muscles balanced. So the next stretch is for the levator scapulae. What that muscle does is it elevates or lifts the shoulder blades, that scapula, and when we're stressed out we tend to kind of hunch up our shoulders and overwork that muscle, so it gets really tender and irritated and at the attachments up top on the neck and down low at that shoulder blade. There's usually those really tender spots that you can push on, and we call those trigger points. So the way to stretch out that muscle is to take the hand on the side that you want to stretch and kind of put it on the back of the shoulder blade where your elbow is coming up a little bit. It doesn't have to be super high, but by doing this that helps stabilize and push that scapula down to keep it in one spot while you're stretching. You're going to take the other hand and put it behind your head because when you pull forward it's going to be at about a 45 degree angle away, so almost like you're looking at your opposite knee. So it's not straightforward down, it's not straight to the side, it's kind of in that angle. So you're just going to come down this way, and you should feel it along that levator muscle right there. So just holding that stretch for about 30 seconds, switch sides, so then you come up stabilizing that shoulder blade and then pulling down towards that opposite knee for 30 seconds, and then doing three on each side. The next set of muscles are "

The next set of muscles are your scalene muscles, and those are the muscles in the front there. When those get tight, they can sometimes cause a little bit of nerve pain because the vessels run through those muscles and underneath those muscles, so when they get tight, they can put a lot of pressure on everything. So the way to stretch that is if you want to stretch your right side, you're going to take your left hand and place it just above that collarbone kind of on those muscles. That's going to kind of help stabilize that collarbone because they're connected there at that clavicle, and so you want to keep it stabilized. You're going to turn your head towards that side and then look up towards the ceiling while you're putting a little pressure downwards on that collarbone. So again you're going to hold that for 30 seconds, come back down, switch sides, opposite right over there turn your head, and look up getting that nice stretch through there, and doing that three times on each side.

The last set of exercises are going to be to strengthen the muscles a little bit, but they're going to be isometric exercises which is you're not actually moving but you're contracting the muscles. So the way to do that is we're going to go back to those motions, but we're going to put our hand on our head so we're not moving our head anymore, but we're pushing into that direction. So for a side bend, you want to put your hand on the side. This is the motion that you're going to do, but you're going to push into your hands and your head's not actually moving. With this sometimes if your neck is painful, if you push really really hard, it hurts, so you want to feel tension, you want to feel pressure, but you don't want it to be painful. So you might want to start off with just about a fifty percent push. So pushing into your head, and then relaxing. I'm moving my head a little bit just so you can see what I'm doing, but you really shouldn't be moving anything. You're pushing into your hand, getting that pressure. You might be able to see those muscles activating and then relaxing, so for just about five seconds push in, relax, and do three on each side. So if you want to alternate back and forth to give one side a break you can. So pushing in and then coming back, so about three to five seconds and then relax. So then the next one is going to be that rotation motion, so again you're doing that movement, but you're not going anywhere. So holding holding your head again, but now I'm doing that rotational movement. Pushing into my hand, so again about three to five seconds, switch sides, turning in that way three to five seconds, and then doing three on each side. And then the last one is going to be going forward. So again just pushing in your hand, but now it's going to be on your forehead. So just kind of put the the bottom of the palm there so it's comfortable, and then you're pushing in like you're doing that motion, so again pushing in three to five seconds, relaxing, pushing in three to five seconds, three times.

And, as soon as they were lowered to the ground, that's our cue to access the emergency medical services, call 911, or call a code. At this point, once we lower them down to the ground, after calling 911, we're going to go straight to 30 chest compressions. We're going to do those 30 chest compressions and then open the airway. Look in the mouth, check for an obstruction. If we see the obstruction, we're actually going to reach in. Now, watch as we reach in, here. We're actually going to go with a hooking motion with one finger, to the side of the mouth. Go towards the back, grab that object, and pull it out. Once the object is out, we're going to go ahead and cover the mouth and nose with a mask and attempt one breath. We attempt one breath, it does not go in. We re-position the head. Attempt another breath. It still doesn't go in, so we go right back to 30 chest compressions. After 30 chest compressions, we put our mask back on the face, attempt the breath. If it doesn't go in, we re-position the head. Attempt another breath. If it still doesn't go in, we go right back to chest compressions. If, at some point, when we try the rescue breath and it goes in, we're going to deliver a second rescue breath and then check for a carotid pulse, no longer than 10 seconds. If we find that there is a good, palpable, or ""feel-able"", pulse -- easily ""feel-able,"" we know that this person is not in cardiac arrest. But, if they're not breathing, we're going to begin rescue breathing. If there's no pulse, no breathing, we're going to go right, straight into CPR. So, I just lowered him to the ground. He was conscious and choking, now he's unconscious. Now I'm going to call 911. Hey, you in the plaid shirt, go call 911, I've got a person who is now unconscious from choking. Please return and let me know that you've called them. At this point, I'm going to start my 30 chest compressions. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 27, 28, 29, 30. I don't see anything. I'm going to attempt a breath. Nothing went in, I'm going to re-position once and try another breath. Nothing went in.

Still don't see anything. Try a breath. Didn't go in. I'm going to re-position and try again. Nothing went in. I'm going to continue with 30 chest compressions. After 30 chest compressions, if I tried a breath and it went in, I'd give another breath, check for a pulse. If there was an easily palpable pulse, but no breathing, I would continue rescue breathing. If there was no pulse and no breathing, I would start CPR. "

Some type of splinting material will be necessary. Splinting material like this one found in a commercial first aid kit is ideal for splinting the fractured hand. If commercial splinting material is not available, rolled up newspapers or other rigid material may be used as a temporary splinting device. The goal is to try and form the splinting material that will not only fit the arm, but form an upward region that the person can grasp with the hand as the splinting material is applied. Once applied, some type of pressure bandage or gauze can be used to wrap around the region and keep the rigidity of the splint in place. Once the rigidity of the splint and the application of a pressure bandage or gauze is in place, some type of cold compress or ice can be used to help reduce swelling and pain. Do not apply the ice or cold compress to the bare skin, as this may cause a cold injury. Some type of cloth between the cold application of ice or the compress can be laid on top of some type of cloth material, insulating the skin from direct contact to the cold. Cold will constrict the vascular system and reduce blood flow, reducing swelling and pain to the region. "

243,How to properly remove a splinter?,00:11,01:31,11,91,124,21lK38lr7L0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21lK38lr7L0,"To remove a splinter, follow these tips from dermatologists: To prevent infection, wash your hands and the affected area with soap and water, and pat your skin dry. If it’s very small, use a magnifying glass to see how big the splinter is and which direction it entered the skin. If part of the splinter is sticking out, use tweezers to gently pull out the splinter. First, sterilize the tip of the tweezers using rubbing alcohol. Then, pull out the splinter in the same direction that it entered the skin. Never squeeze out a splinter, as this may cause it to break into smaller pieces that are harder to remove. If the entire splinter is embedded under the skin, use a small needle to remove it. Sterilize the needle and a pair of tweezers using rubbing alcohol. Afterwards, look through a magnifying glass and use the needle to gently pierce the surface of the skin at one end of the splinter. Continue to use the needle to carefully push out part of the splinter. Once one end of the splinter is sticking out, use the tweezers to gently pull out the splinter. After the splinter has been removed, clean the area with soap and water and apply petroleum jelly. Keep the area covered with a bandage until it heals. "

I've had some people try and do that. you want to keep your back upright and just get that pull at your neck. so you're really getting that good stretch right through there. so nice hold getting that stretch and then just looking straight down towards that opposite knee, and if you feel like "

248,How one can do seated knee to chest stretch?,08:04,11:55,484,715,1206,ustoPh3DggY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ustoPh3DggY,"gonna do is just bring your knee up towards your chest. so it's just how it sounds. the key is don't bring your body forward, bring your knee up towards your chest. if you can't bring it as high as mine that's fine. you know if you can only bring it here and you're starting to feel a stretch that's cool. okay if you have some knee issues, instead of holding it like this, you might want to grab underneath and pull it up. I tell my patients to do that a lot, but if you don't really have any issues sometimes you can get a better pull when you're pulling on the outside versus the inside, but make sure you don't end up irritating your knee by doing this stretch. but when you stretch and you're pulling up you should feel a little stretch in your bottom area, in your low back. that's where you're trying to stretch. some people feel a little pinching in their groin area, so if you're feeling that little bit of a pinching either bring your your hip out a little bit with your knee, or just don't pull up as high because again you don't want to be pinching something and get it hurting while you're trying to stretch something else out. but if you're not feeling that that pinch in there, just give it a nice pull and get that stretch as much as you can, and then take that little break in between. so make sure that if you're sitting at a desk move out a little bit so you don't bang that knee into the desk, but just get that nice little pull. I like having the outside hand up on top and the inside on the bottom I just feel like that's more comfortable for me. again you can kind of just hold it this way if you want to as long as you don't have any finger issues or knee issues, but again if you have some knee pain already just go ahead and grab underneath and pull up and you're you're still going to give the same benefit by holding up that stretch this way. but again don't curl down and stretch like that keep your back nice and straight and relax because anytime you're stretching something you really want your whole body to be fairly relaxed. so if you're tensing up other muscles to try and do it then you're kind of defeating the whole point. so if this is hard and you're having a hard time pulling that knee up then you can definitely do this lying down which might feel a little more comfortable for people. you just might want to wait till you get home to do it. and you can check out some of my other videos to be able to do it on the ground at home or even on your bed if you don't want to lie on the ground. or if it's too hard to get up, you can do it lie on your bed or on the couch as well so lots of different places to try it, lots of different positions to try it, but just getting that nice stretch in there. and again you should feel kind of in that low back area kind of in the bottom area getting a good stretch in there. again pulling up. some people ask about the foot should it be pulled up should it be pointed down should it be relaxed. kind of goes back to the same thing that I was talking about when you're stretching, I really feel like you should be relaxed. so some people might feel more of a stretch if they're pulling their toes up, but then again you're activating muscles and the point of a stretch is to get those muscles nice and elongated and stretched out so, if you're if you're contracting something, sometimes you're defeating that point just a little bit. so again just taking a little rest break in between. sometimes if you're on a harder chair versus softer chair it might you know make it a little bit harder or easier depending on what kind of chair surface you're on, but if it's a little bit harder it might be easier to get the stretch but you might have a little more pressure on the sit bone, so just make sure you're comfortable again while you're doing it because you don't want to irritate anything down there while you're doing this stretch. and again if you feel like you're getting a lot of pressure on that knee you can even kind of bring it out a little bit because you're really focusing on pulling this part up. but again if you want to get that knee in there too then "

250,How do I do anterior tibialis stretch to treat shin splints?,15:54,18:27,954,1107,1206,ustoPh3DggY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ustoPh3DggY,"tibialis stretch. so with the anterior tibialis, a lot of times if you have shin splints, this is the muscle that's irritated. so an easy way to stretch that out is just take your foot behind you, and you want your toes the top of the toes to be flat on the floor. so I'm putting that on the floor to stretch out your leg doesn't have to be completely straight. you can bend your knee a little bit, but you want to feel the stretch through right there. so a lot of times when you're stretching, you don't have to push really hard to get that stretch. you can also move your foot around a little bit to stretch the inside and then stretch the outside. so you're kind of getting that whole shin area. and I like doing that especially after I do exercises or if I go for a run. so if I have my foot down like this, I can kind of turn it in to get that inside of the shin and then I can roll my toes to the outside really to get that anterior tib stretch right there. and a lot of times when people do this, if you get cramping in your feet this might trigger that cramping, so I would say if you get a lot of cramping, maybe stretch with your shoes on first, and see how you feel. if you're if you're starting to get some cramping, then I wouldn't do it without your shoes on. but if you're not getting any cramping, you're probably going to get a little bit better stretch if you take your shoes off. so again just kind of putting your foot back again you can bend your knee a little bit. straightening out completely is fine. you might get a little bit better stretch, but you don't have to. you can keep it a little bit and again I like to kind of halfway through roll it to the outside and then roll it to the inside. so you can kind of see let me pull up there so you can see, I'm pushing down on the big toe there and then kind of rolling out to the the pinky toes right there. just to get that stretch all the way around. but again like I said sometimes if people have a tendency to have some cramping that might try and make your foot cramp just a little bit, so be gentle with it at first. don't go too crazy with it just as a warning, so you'll know that that might happen to you, but again a lot of times people who walk a lot people who run if you're running on surfaces that a little bit harder like concrete or roads with the pavement and stuff like that, people do tend to get some shin splints. so this is a really good stretch to do especially if you're exercising after you exercise, but a lot of times it's "

262,How to fix the shoulder problem?,08:49,12:33,529,753,828,B4UYaumLy90,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4UYaumLy90,"that I prescribe my patients all the time and also how to use some massage balls to into those tight areas too. The first stretch that you're gonna need to do, involves using one of these, which I believe is called a power band or a strength band. You can get these fairly cheap and you get it from Amazon. This is a medium, anything lighter than that you're probably not going to get enough stretch, anything stronger than that and it's probably going to be too strong. So anyway, with the band, find somewhere in the gym that you can hook it up or somewhere at home. Once you've got it attached, looped over something above you, put your hand through the band, turn your palm up, face away from the band. Now right now I'm close to the band so there's hardly any stretch going through my arm. Straighten out your arm, lift your chest and gradually step away from where you've attached the band. You should feel the stretch around the front of your shoulder, possibly even going into your bicep. Once you've done that, same setup for the next stretch, put your hand through, turn away and lean forward. This allows you to get your arm bent behind your back. With your free hand, hold onto your fingers of the hand that's through the loop and then step away and as you step away, gradually lift your chest. And what you wanna try and do is pull this arm, this elbow away from your body. Once you're finish, step back, lean forwards and allow yourself to come out of the band. And the last stretch I think you guys should probably do, is this one up into full flexion. So get your arm through the band, take it out in front of you and gradually your walk forwards keeping your arms straight until you feel it stretch and just try and push your chest and head through. So here's something else I really like using and that is massage balls. This is the lacrosse ball, but a massage ball, lacrosse ball, hockey ball, anything that's hard enough to get into those small muscles will be perfect. I like these because they get into those small muscles that are hard to reach when you're using a foam roller. So what you're gonna do is try and get into your rotator cuff. The principle is that you find a tender point, press into it and hold in that position. If you hold long enough, that pain will start to disappear. So to get into your rotator cuff, get the ball, place it underneath your arm, with your free hand pull so that you can get this ball further round behind you, then come up against a wall and press in against the wall, move around until you can find a tender point. Once you have a tender point, just stay there, relax and apply some pressure. Maintain that pressure until that pain starts to go away or you've done about a minute. Once a minute has passed, moved to a different point and repeat the process again. Then to get up into these upper muscles, you need to do a bit more contortion. So place the ball up and over, but this time you're gonna have to lean back into the wall, lean up against the wall. Again, find those tender points, hold and stay for about a minute. So that's pretty much all I'd recommend for now, guys. "
263,How to do motion tests?,05:03,08:51,303,531,828,B4UYaumLy90,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4UYaumLy90,"So let me just put everything I've told you into context for you. Most people who come in to see me have pain in this upper frontal region of the shoulder. To me, that usually indicates that there's some kind of tendon, ligament or bursa issue and in my experience, that is usually because people are extremely tight through the muscles in and around the shoulder. Most commonly that tightness comes from the rotator cuff muscles that I showed you earlier. In order to confirm whether it's tightness causing these issues, I usually do a couple of tests. The first thing I usually get people to do, is to show me their ranges of movement. So I'll get them standing in front of me and get them to perform complete abduction, all the way up to the ceiling and back down and then following on from that, I'll get them to their lift the arms up to the front as far as they can and down. And what I usually see in most people, is that they're quite limited in fore flexion. So what I look at them from the side, they're maximum range of movement is to about here. What I would like to see is full range of movement, where the arm is right up by the ear. After that I'll get them to do the painful arc test. And what you do is you stand, arms down by your side and take your arm all the way up to the ceiling and note where they're getting pain. If it's a supraspinatus tendonitis or a bursitis in this sort of short upper subacromial region, they'll usually feel pain between about 40 degrees to about 120 degrees. Now, the reason that that happens is because as you get to this sort of area here, the space between the humeral bone and acromion is completely minimized, like I showed you earlier. After that test, I will get them to do the scratch test and it looks like this. What you're gonna do is take one arm behind you and reach up as far up your back as you can. Once you've done that, take the arm down, do the same on the other side and then back down and note where both hands or both tips of fingers reach up. Quite often what you see is the side, the shoulder that has the pain, will be quite restricted and will not be able to go as far up as the good side. Now on the demonstration I just did, what you might be able to see, is that my left arm can reach up my back fairly high, but when it comes to the right side, there's a lot less range, which indicates that my right side is tight in either extension or internal rotation or even just a combination of the two together. This would indicate to me, if it was a patient, that they need to be doing more stretching in those ranges. So if you're having shoulder pain or shoulder discomfort, definitely go through these tests. Have a look at your range of movement first of all, see if you can get those arms all the way up to the ceiling. If you can't, you know you're tight, then take your arms behind you, do that scratch test. If you're struggling to get your arm behind you, then that's an indication that definitely tightness in the front or in the rotator cuff muscles. And that will mean that you need to then stretch in a more extension or internal rotation. And since we're on the subject of stretching, I'm gonna show you now some really effective stretches that I prescribe my patients all the time "

Or S.I. So we're gonna start off the first, That's what the red tape for is, by the way. It indicates it's on his right side. - Okay. - Why don't you lay flat on your back, Brad. Very simple test, figure four or Patrick test this is called. Yep, he's gonna put this one down and this one across like that. So he's crossed his leg. He's making a four here, if you can see that. And all you do is you push down here and you hold right here and you push down. - Not too hard, just gentle - No, just gentle pressure. And if he gets pain, if he gets his same pain, if it reproduces his pain on the right side that's a possibility that's the S.I. - Right. The more tests that are positive the more likely it's gonna be your S.I. - Right. - All right, let's go right into the next one Brad. Next one you're gonna go ahead and put the leg off the edge here. Don't fall off the bed. (Brad makes falling noise) Don't fall off the bed. - Okay. - Okay. So this one goes down, this one goes up like this. Like that, yep. You can actually hold on it. - Yep, I got it. - But I'm gonna actually push down on this one while I'm pushing on that one too. So again, gentle pressure. Same thing, does this reproduce your pain Brad? Does this make the pain replicated? - Right, and no it doesn't. - Okay. Okay. No, it doesn't. You're not helping me at all. All right, next one we're gonna do is we're gonna actually have Brad lay on his side, like this, and what I'm doing on this one on the pelvis, I'm gonna push right on the pelvis here. Okay? So right, show it on here. So he's right like this, I'm just gonna go ahead and push right on the pelvis, right on the flare of here, of the ilium. Easy one to do. So we're just gonna go ahead and push. Pressure on, pressure on. Any pain with that Brad? - Pain with pressure, yes. - Okay. So now we got a positive one - Right there. Right there. - So, again obviously with all these tests you're gonna need someone to help ya. The last one we're gonna do, very simple. We're actually gonna throw an extra one in there that we said three tests, this is gonna be four. Lay flat on your stomach Brad. On this one we're just gonna go, right, you know where the belt is. We're gonna push right on the sacrum itself, right on that triangle. So I'm just putting a hand here, pushing another hand on here and pushing down like that. - Yeah. And actually it's below the belt. - Yep, a little. Yep, exactly. I'm not, I'm putting pressure on my palm is what I'm doing. So I'm putting pressure right on the sacrum. Pressure on, pressure off.

What you do is you actually push on his pelvis, have someone - Squeeze a little. - This is a little strange. Pushing right on the pelvis. Like right there. - Yep. - And we have 'em walk. And if before, if they were having pain when they walked, when they were walking, and now they don't that's a good indicator that that S.I. belt might help. - Right. - 'Cause when do you have pain with S.I.? - Weight bearing typically. - Usually weight bearing, yep. And it's usually worse with stairs and running and you can even feel it sitting when you're weight bearing on the pelvis with that, so. - Some impact activities where it puts the weight through.

So anyway, what the the cue here is we're looking for is after 30 seconds, if the pain is getting worse, it's too early for this. - Mm-hmm. - You just, you're not allowed to do that yet. So if it is fine after 30 seconds, it gets numb or it started to plateau, you can keep doing it. In fact, you could do this for up to 15 minutes. Which most of you will not be able to do because it's just too long. But you can do it, spread it throughout the day. - Yup. - Another alternative to this, Brad, would be just doing, this is the McKenzie method, here: "

It definitely shouldn't make it worse. - Sure. - It could be plateaued or the same. But if you're too tender to do massage, start with that first. - Sure. That makes sense. - Go to the massage, and eventually the massage you can do probably every other day for 15 minutes, or like I said, three times a day for five minutes. "

So you're going to actually go down. I would start more in the muscle belly, and not straight down in, but at an angle. So we got going across the fibers, which run this way. And then you can work that. And you may find some of these muscles actually getting knotted up as a result of this injury. So you want to get those knots out. And you know, after the longer you do it you should feel those knots relax and release, we call it. And work your way closer to where the injury is, that tendon. But it shouldn't get to the point where you're feeling ""ow!"" pain. You know, it should feel like feeling good. It's kind of relaxed. - Kind of a feeling good pain. - Yup. - Yeah. And that's, you know, pretty much in all cases here you're going to want to work on that extensor wad, they call it. That wad of muscles there.

That's really cranking on that internal rotation. - Again, no pain though. No sharp pain, just a stretch feeling. - I don't know, I think there's a couple reasons why this works so well. I think it also kind of puts the scapula up in the right position, but I don't know. - Sure, yeah. - What do I know? (chuckles) - I think you're right, Bob, though.

Liz will be completely relaxed, her right hip is the one with pain, when she walks it goes up and down steps usually gives that sharp pain . Simply what you're gonna do is have the person relax, and grab the ankles, I'll just kind of wiggle the leg a little bit to make sure they're relaxed and not tense, and then gently pull this direction so we're putting traction on it. And I'll do this and say, ""How does that feel?"" With a little pressure, and I mean just a little bit, and if the person says, ""Oh, that feels kind of good,"" then I'll pull a little bit more and if that feels better, I'm never gonna get to the point where I'm pulling aggressively. - [Bob] Brad, I wanna make sure that the people know too, you would never do this with a total hip replacement. - Right, this is, you wouldn't have arthritis from a total hip, yeah, if it's a total hip, it's time to go to the doctor. - [Bob] Right. - And get the orthopedic surgeon to look at, they'll probably take x-rays and whatnot. So, I'll do that, sometimes I'll pull on it, but it really won't respond well, so then I'll take the toes, or the leg and internally rotate it slightly, just a little bit, not gonna twist hard, just a little bit till it stops, and then I'll pull again and see how it responds there, and then I may go the other direction, 'cause sometimes, one direction, either inward or outward, can make a big difference on the reduction-- - [Bob] Yes, it can reproduce, no, take away the pain is what I'm trying to say. - Abolish it, Bob. - [Bob] Abolish it, how's that word? - If none of those work then I'll do this, and I'll abduct or go out to the side, a little bit, and then I'll put a little traction on it, and also I can rotate outward or inward gently, and all of this is gentle. You do not need to pull hard, if it's gonna work, it's gonna work really well, and the person will say, ""Oh, that feels good,"" and then, I've done it where I've just held people there for 30 seconds until I get too tired, and then I'll relax, and it can be real beneficial.

And once you get it to relax that's the traction, the way the legs are traction like me pulling, and then you're gonna swing it forward and backwards gently, this is like the pendulum exercise for the shoulder, almost identical, now, you can put an ankle weight on, if it feels better. - [Bob] And that's what Liz has in place right there. - Now, a lot of people don't have an ankle weight, but if you happen to live in a northern climate like we do, you can just put a pair of winter boots on. (laughter) - They weigh about a pound or two, or steel toe boots, if someone has some steel toe boots, anything it gives them weight, and the idea is to relax that leg and just swing it forward and backwards, there you go. How's that feel, Liz? She say's it's incredible. - [Bob] Liz can have Wesley hang onto her leg there, she's got a little three-year-old. - Oh, yeah, that'd be great. - [Bob] You know, how they hold onto your legs when you try to walk.

And it works best on a plank that's the right heighth, and if you have an adjustable one that works better, but we'll show you one of our tricks. So why don't you bring that knee up, and actually when I was in PT school, this is one of the first treatments I did on a real patient, she had severe arthritis in her hip, she was young, she was like 40-years-old. - [Bob] Brad, you probably wanna use a towel, too. - Yep, we've got it right here, don't worry, Bob. - [Bob] All right, you're getting me worried there. So he's putting the towel around his waist and around Liz's thigh. - Okay, so Liz is gonna put the towel where it belongs. So we got it around her femur, okay? And what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hold her knee and bring this up to 90 degrees, and she's relaxed, you feel comfortable? This is kind of hard to see, but it's around my waist, and I'm gonna push outwards with my waist while I stabilize her knee, and that's gonna put traction instead of in a sagittal plane, it's gonna go in a lateral plane or abduct it, and can you feel that, Liz? Does that feel good? Yeah, see, thumbs up. This does typically feel good, whether you got a good hip or a bad hip because we're just gently stretching it, and I'll stretch this way, I may hold it as long as it feels good, if the person says, ""Oh, that feels good,"" I'll hold it usually as long as I can, which is, you know, 30 seconds, a minute, and then I'll need a little break. Sometimes I may go to this angle, or straight, and I'll work whichever works good, Sometimes I'll move it gently if it feels good, so we get some motion. Now, we mentioned if there's a pinched tissue, or the capsule might be pinched in there, if we can get it out of there and unpinched, and we can move it so it stays out, then you're successful and you'll be able to walk around, and, you know, as a therapist you feel like (gasp) and the patient loves you because you just cured their extremely sore hip. So this doesn't work in all the hips, of course, but it's easy to do, especially the traction and the standing, and there's no negative effects to it-- - [Bob] Now I was actually able to do this to myself. I took a belt and I put it around a stable object, it was actually a weight bench. - Oh, really? - [Bob] And then I just scooted myself away from it, yeah, and it actually took away my hip pain, I was having troubles with it.

The first one, Brad's gonna show it from the side, is, we're gonna do flexion, and, you know, if you can only go up like this high and if you're having trouble raising it, that might be something else, then, but-- - Yeah, usually frozen shoulder from my experience, it goes up and it just wants to stop. It's not real painful going though there, but it doesn't go-- - Right. It doesn't want to come up. - And then if you try and push it or help it with the other hand, it still doesn't want to go. - Well you're giving it away! - I'm sorry, Bob! - You're jumping ahead here! - I jumped the gun, I jumped the gun. - So the next one is abduction. So, it's gonna be limited in this way when you lift it up. When you lift it up on your own it's gonna be limited this way, and then when you put your arm at a right angle, the elbow, and then you try to go out, this is the one that tends to really be limited, Brad. So like this is average, going way out here. You might only be able to go to here. - Sure. - You can't get, you know, any movement, hardly at all. This is the key, though, 'cause there are other things that can cause you to be limited this way. Y'know, a torn rotator cuff. But, if you now take a stick or a yardstick or a broomstick or a Booyah stick. - Sure. - And you're gonna use the one arm to help the other. So now you're gonna check flexion again, and in this case, if it's a frozen shoulder, you still won't be able to go any further than you did before. If it's not frozen, you're gonna be able to lift it. - Right, like impingement, which is a very common-- That kind of hurts when you get through here, but once you get so far, then it's not so bad anymore, is typical. - Same with a torn rotator cuff. If it's torn and it's not frozen along with it, you're gonna be able to go beyond the original. So, the next one, we did abduction before, we only got this high, remember? So we tried again, now if you go this high on this one, it's not frozen. You were only gonna go that high again. - So, just to make it clear, so the good arm is doing all the work. - Yeah, this arm is helping it, making it go up. - Because obviously, you wouldn't be able to lift it like this. - Right. In the clinic, I don't use a Booyah-- - Yeah, you just do it with your arm. - I do it manually, and I get a good feel for it, but obviously you can't do that by yourself at home. - Right, you could do it with a pulley. - Sure. - A pulley system. The last one, okay, again, we went out like this, remember, and this one only went this far, now I'm gonna grab on and again I only go this far, that's a good sign that it's possibly a frozen shoulder. If you can go like this, unlikely to be a frozen shoulder, 'cause you've got good passive range of motion. "

Note whether the hurt finger becomes swollen and red and is difficult to move shortly after the injury. This is a sign that the finger is broken.

That's when we're gonna do that one-third of the depth of the full chest for our compressions at a rate of 100 to a hundred and twenty times per minute. You can also see now that I have that open this brachial artery location is right here right between the bicep and tricep against their little humorous bone, because they really don't have much of a neck to find a carotid artery so we have to actually use the brachial artery for that location. Another thing to keep in mind is you can really see here that they like to you know they've got such a big head compared to the rest of their body that tends to put their chin down on their chest. So we're gonna want to just get something a little bit underneath their shoulder blades is a nice shortcut that still firm and won't let them sink into the mattress we were doing compressions, but that helps to hold their head in that slipping position. These are all important landmarks when it comes to where to actually do the compression's the only other variation is the circumferential compressions where we hold around the baby's chest and we place our thumbs right in that same sternum "

There's a bunch of different ways you can stretch your calves, but i'm just going to show you with a strap. So you can use a stretch strap if you have one, if you don't, you can use a dog leash or you can just use a big beach towel or even a belt, but you want it to be something solid not one of those resistance bands. So just wrap it kind of around the ball of your foot. You want to relax your foot so you're not actively moving it, you're using the strap or the belt to actually pull your foot. So just relax it and then give it a nice pull until you feel a stretch in your calf area. You want your knee to be straight, so some people might bend a little bit, but that's not getting that stretch in your calves, so keep the leg nice and straight. Feel that stretch there and hold that stretch for about 30 seconds. Take a little break in between and then do three of those. So just really getting that stretch getting that flexibility in the feet is really important. Cause a lot of times when you have that neuropathy in your feet, you tend to not feel where your feet are and sometimes you stumble, trip, and fall, and so having good flexibility and strength helps that out as well.

The next set of exercises you want to have your heel free-moving. So if you've got a foam roll, or if you want to sit on the edge of something and let your foot hanging off, you want to be able to move that heel. So if you're flat on the floor or something, you don't have quite as much movement. But this time what you're going to do is just an ankle pump. So pulling your foot up and then pushing it down, so really just getting some good movement in the ankle. So you don't have to go fast, make sure you get a good push at the end. A good pull at the top, and just start off with about 10 of those. You don't have to do a whole lot. Then the next thing is going to be ankle circles, so now you're just making a circle at your ankle. It's not your whole leg, sometimes people want to kind of move the whole leg, try and keep the leg staying still and get most of that movement at the ankle. So do about ten one way and then reverse it and do it the other way. So just do 10 of each of those. So the next set of "

You're just going to do a straight leg raise. so you want to keep the leg nice and straight, locked out to keep it straight. If you pull up your toes, that helps keep it locked out, and keep that knee straight as well. With a straight leg raise, you just want to lift it to about the height of the other side. So you don't have to get super high, you have to get about that much motion in there, and then slowly come back down. You're really trying to control this movement, so you're not, you know, using momentum just to kick it up and down, you really want to control that. Work those muscles, get everything nice and strong in there. So just start off with about 10, then you can do a couple sets of ten, and then work your way up from there. So you do both sides, and then you're going to do "

The leg on the bottom can be kind of bent, but you want your whole body to be in a straight line. A lot of times people if they kick up, they'll kick kind of forward, but that's not really working those hip abductor muscles. So pull your toes tight again and almost lead with your heel slightly back behind you, so you're kicking back that way. So a lot of people want to do that, but again that's not getting those abductor muscles, so make sure you're leading with that heel and going back just a little bit.

So go up nice and slow and come down with a controlled motion. So it's not just going up and down, but really controlling that movement, making those muscles work, and then pull your toes up when you come back down. So you're just going to go all the way up with the heels, slowly come down, and then pull the toes up. So just start off again with about 10 of these, and then you can work your way up to 15 to 20.

Try and get to at least 10 seconds, work your way up to 30 seconds or even a minute. If that becomes easy, then you can go to one hand, and then you can even go to no hands. If all that becomes easy and you're switching back and forth a couple times, there's no problems with that, then if you really want to challenge yourself, you can try closing your eyes.

And you'll a lot of times I'll have patients say, yeah I feel it stretched right back in here. And that's what it's doing. - That's what you wanna do. - You bet. - I, I've seen people too, take the, you know, the increase of their and go like this and really stretch it. - Yeah. - And that, that sometimes that feels really good Brad to do that stretch. - And it makes funny faces, too. - Yeah.

I'm going to first show you a test, Brad, that you can do to see if you have rounded shoulders. Can I stand up, Liz? All right, Liz says I can stand up. So- - You still got his head in there? (laughs) - Yeah, really, you know, that's why I got a face for radio. So you're gonna look at your thumbs is what you're gonna do. As you just stand here normally, look how my thumbs are pointing towards each other. - Oh, when you're standing, yeah. - Yeah, that means my shoulders are a little bit internally rotated. - Yeah, so this... I don't know if you can see the white stripes, but from here to here, big difference in how things are working. - Now straighten up once, Brad. Straighten up and watch the thumbs. The thumbs start pointing towards the front now. That's what you want. - Where you're walking, yep. - Now the first thing, the first of this three-step program... Watch this once. If I round my upper back, watch what it does to my shoulders. See my shoulders- - Well they come towards me, Bob. - Yeah and they rounded, but watch my thumbs. - Oh yeah! - Okay, my thumbs are straight forward. Now I'm gonna just round my upper back. Look at that, they go right towards each other. - Just like little magnets. "
378,How to use tennis balls to fix rounded shoulders?,02:33,05:28,153,328,734,o3JuzlS8lps,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3JuzlS8lps,"One of the best ways we have found for doing this is actually just take a couple balls or even one tennis ball, and if you can want to come back here, Brad. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - And what you're gonna do is you're going to lie on these things- - Mmm. - And you're gonna hit these different spots. Like here, here, here, here, here, here. And you can start off by actually doing it up against the wall. Do you mind doing that, Brad? - No, sure. So the whole idea is we're trying to, if you are tight in the thoracic rib cage where we're talking about, we're gonna loosen that up so this posture is possible. - Yeah, and if you've been doing it for a number of years, this area can really tighten up. I mean, it's got heavy ligaments that hold the bones together. So that's why we have you start against the wall because this can be a very aggressive treatment. But when you do it against the wall, you can control how much pressure you're putting against it. - And the reason we use a sock, you can see, I can easily control- - Yeah, you can move it around. - Where it is. I am gonna be on the left side of the spine and you can roll up and down. You don't have to. And I'm pushing in pretty aggressively. - And even do a little bit of this, Brad, right? - Yeah, there you go. That's a good idea. Ooh! - Even some angels while you're doing that. Someday, Brad, right? - Breathe. - You'll be an angel. - Well, yeah. When the bell rings. - (laughs) The bell rings. - You know, from that movie? Every time a bell rings, you get some wings. - Yeah. So now, as soon as you're able, I want you to progress to lying on the floor and that's gonna be a lot more aggressive. I'm going to do it right here, Brad, even though- - Yeah, you would not do it on your bed. - You wouldn't do it on the bed because it wouldn't work. - A carpeted floor works really well. - So the same thing here, I'm just gonna show you the positioning, basically. I'm going to put it in place. Now this is again, very aggressive for a first-time beginner. You may want to have a pillow so that the pillow takes off some of the stress. Sometimes we even put some towels over the balls to take some of the stress off. - [Brad] Right, exactly, so it's not so aggressive. - Again, with the soft surface it's not aggressive at all, to be honest with you, but I'm just showing you when it's in place like this, you can again, roll back and forth on it or you can do some deep breaths like this with your arms up overhead. And you want to hit the different spots. What I do every morning, did it this morning, is I lie down on my back and I put my foot up and I'm stretching my hamstring. I got a railing right there, and I lie on this thing. - [Brad] Do you use a pillow or no? - I don't use a pillow. - [Brad] Once you get used to it, you may feel comfortable without the pillow. - Right. But that works better than anything I've found for improving my posture up here. I've pretty much eliminated having pain up there as far as knots, so. - Because, so, you're getting, in your case, you're getting hamstring stretch, you're working on your posture and you're relaxing those muscles. - That's right. Triple task there. - The multitask times three, yep. "

The next one, as an alternative to that you might try a ball in a chair, Brad. - Oh. I thought you were gonna say a ball and a chain. (laughs) Wow! - Don't you even make any jokes about that, Brad. - (laughs) Okay. But no, you take a soft ball that's squishy. This is like that kickball kind that says Crane on it. I bought this at a store. It was at the end and it's like, it's only three dollars! - That completely brings me back to my childhood. - It does! - Doesn't it? - We used to play kickball. - With this type of ball. - Yeah and it was fun. So, you know, that's a double whammy. You get to enjoy your history, if you're 50 years and older. - Yeah, little nostalgia. - And now, so the soft ball allows you to roll into it. - But look what he's doing here: he's extending, but he's gonna externally rotate at the same time. - Right, so we're doing... Breathing in and exhale and relax and arch over that ball and arms back so we're getting a complete stretch to get that posture where we want it to go. You might adjust the ball up and down. And I wouldn't say might, but you should. You'll find that certain locations it feels better and you may, and probably will, feel your back do a little cracking. - Sure. (cracks) This one's really a nice exercise cause it's actually leading into the second phase of what you need to do to fix around your shoulders, and that is, you've got to stretch the pectoralis major here and minor and the internal rotators. So internal rotation is this: they bring the shoulder in like this or in like this. That's what internally rotates your shoulders. We want to stretch them so that you can externally rotate the shoulder. - That gets the thumbs in the right position. - That's one way to do it. "

Another way is, sometimes, if you could picture a door frame right here, you can actually put just one arm up and lean into the door and that would actually put a stretch and you're actually going into external rotation a little bit. You can use a corner. Brad, do you want to show it on a corner? - Sure. So yeah, there, yep. And no, you can go on both. I was saying as both. Now you can lean in and see how he's stretching the chest, but he's also stretching the arms into external rotation a little bit. You can even move the arms out while he's doing that. - [Brad] Well, that helped right there from here to here. - [Bob] Yep, there you go. - Yep. Don't get too aggressive with this. That can be pretty aggressive. If you've never done it just take it gentle the first few times. Get a feel for it. - Exactly, if you've never done it before. That's the key, isn't it, Brad? "

Why don't you show with that band, Brad and then I'll show with one of the bands over here. - So the stretching is very important. Those two steps, do those first. - Yeah. - Once you get loosened up, then do the strengthening. This is just a typical tube stretch band. The handles are removed, which you don't need, in this case. You can go single. - You can use a loop. You could, you know, there's a lot of different things you could use for this. - Yeah, I had a patient, she used a rubber snubber for holding sound stuff in the car. - A rubber what? - Rubber snubber. You know, it's got the hooks for holding down stuff in your car. - Rubber snubber? - Oh Bob's so out of the loop. (laughs) They got hooks for holding down things on the back of your car so like your- - Bungee cord, right! - Yes! - Who calls it a rubber snubber? Is that from the '20s or something? - Bob, Bob, you're out of the loop. (chuckles) (indistinct) rubber. Okay, here we go. - I remember back in the '20s. - There we go. So we're going to do this. - Yep. So he's externally rotating the shoulders, but he's also extending back a little bit. So he's tightening the muscles between the shoulder blades a little bit, too, and you can see how his shoulders, his shirt is wrinkling up there and that whites are coming together. So you're catching both strengthening aspects at the same time. Works really well. - And we can go to this and do the- - Sure. - Like ""The W"" we call it. Just don't let it get you in the face. - Well a better option for that, Brad, is if you want to come over here, Liz. - [Brad] Exactly. - Use our wall anchors. If you have them for other reasons, anyway, you can go ahead and hook it up at the top one, you can hook it up to the middle one, but you can go ahead and I'm going to go ahead and this is actually the one I do, Brad. I extend, and then I externally rotate. - Sure, so he's getting this. - Extend, externally rotate. - And this. - Extend, externally rotate. And I do like 50 of these- - You do? - In a row, yeah, cause it's a toning muscle, you know, it's a postural muscle. You want to work on- - High reps. - Yep, high reps. And what's nice about the wall anchors is that you can just pop it off, you can put it at a different level and you can do chest or anything else like that at the same time. I gotta put in a little plug for them, right? - Yeah, you should, Bob, but do them the other way, because I think it's important to do them at this level as well, cause you're working, you're working the middle traps versus the lower traps, which lower traps are- - Well here, I'm gonna do it this way. Like this and like this. - Yeah there you go. - Like that. - Got a good view of that, don't you, Liz? Yep, and we want to make sure that, there you go. "

I understand that. Just grab a pillow. - [Brad] Oh yes. Lie on the pillow, and you're going to go down like this, you're going to bring your arms up and you're going to externally rotate. Arms back, externally rotate. Arms back, externally rotate. Now, for those of you who are just starting this, this will be plenty enough stress for you. - [Brad] Yes. - Eventually you might take a couple soup cans. - [Brad] And hold on to them. - Yep. (laughs) Just go to the soup kitchen. - [Brad] Don't just set them on the floor. - Yeah. (laughs) Good point. - You're not gonna do that on your bed because it's too squishy. You need to go... Well, you could, possibly. - Maybe with a couple pillows, right. - Right, but on the floor, carpet floor works well, but yeah, again, you could do it on the bed now that I think about it. - Yeah. "

You can do it on the bed if the loft of your bed is fairly firm. The other thing, remember, we gotta show, Brad... Can you just stand up for a second Brad? - Sure - And we gotta show what a 45 degree angle is. - Yep, yeah. - All right, when you face straight forward, that's zero degrees. If he turns all the way to the right, that's 90 degrees, although your neck is a little tight there, Brad. - Yeah - Halfway in between that's 45. You need to know what a 45 degree angle is because we're gonna do that a number of times. We're also gonna bring the head back, probably, yeah, there we go. We're gonna bring the head back probably 20 degrees, maybe 30 degrees. So you need that. - Not that. - Not that, just about a little tilt back. OK. So, you now know what 45 is, you know what 20 to 30. Alright, Brad, jump up there. These people are in a hurry. Let's go! - All right, here we go. - Alright, we're gonna start with, and we're doing this to the left, so your gonna, that means you have symptoms to the left. You're gonna turn your head 45 degrees to the left. You're using a pillow and that's going to hit you between the shoulder blades. And he goes down, and now he tilts back about 20 to 30 degrees with the angle still maintaining at 45 degrees. You keep your eyes open. He may get dizzy from this. He may get a little vertigo. He may get the eyes shifting back and forth. You wait till that, that goes away, or 20 seconds whichever one comes first. After that, then you go ahead and turn your head 45 degrees to the right. Same thing. You're gonna wait for the symptoms to go away, or you're gonna wait for the 20 seconds to finish. After that, you're gonna go up onto the right shoulder. And when you get up to the right shoulder you're gonna look down, completely look down. Same thing, you're waiting for 20 seconds or you're waiting for the symptoms to abate. Alright, now he's gonna bring his legs off the edge. Now he's gonna push up with his arm. He's keeping his head tilted to the right. And then he slowly brings it to the center. After this, now it's very important, I hope you understand this, 'Cause we talked about this in the last video. I want you to keep your head upright for the rest of the day. Brad and I were talking about this. That's why this is probably a good thing to do in the morning, even, to give plenty of time for those crystals to settle in the right spot. But you want to keep it up up for the rest of the day. They used to say for 48 hours and we used to have people wear a collar, and sleep upright, but now they say that you can just do it until the end of the day, and then you should get good results. Alright. - So, in other words, Bob, I can't look down, I can't shake my head. - You can't can't look down, you can't bend down, you can't put shoes on you can't... - So I'm gonna be doing this. - Yeah. - And can I turn right to left? - Yeah. - OK. - Yep. You can do all those things, just keep your head up. - Yep, OK. - Alright, now we're also gonna show you this from a side angle, so you know another way to do it. - Alright. - OK. Now we're gonna do it from the side position, and we're doing it this time without a pillow so he can just hang his head off the edge of the bed. Head off the edge of the bed. OK. First again, tilt his head 45 degrees to the right, and he is gonna come back. - Left - I'm sorry. Turn his head 45 degrees to the left, and then he is gonna come back. And he's gonna tilt back about 20 to 30 degrees while he's maintaining his head 45 degrees to the left. Again, eyes open, waiting for the symptoms to stop, or 20 seconds, then turns his head to the right, eyes open, waiting for the symptoms to stop. Nausea, dizziness, eyes shaking, whatever you feel. Alright, after that stops, now Brad's gonna go up onto the right shoulder, keeping his head, and then he can actually look down, down to the floor. Same thing, waiting for the symptoms to abate waiting for the... or 20 seconds. He's now gonna push himself up, legs off the edge, push himself up. Head still turned to the right.

You just want to feel a nice tension. I call stretching like a good hurt. It doesn't hurt, hurt, but you're kind of like oh yeah, that feels really good. Because if you're pulling too hard, you're gonna irritate those muscle fibers and then end up having it too sore, or damaging something. Go ahead and relax now. And usually I just say take a 5 - 10 second break. You know, let that muscle reset itself. And then go ahead and start again. So we're gonna pull back again for another :30 seconds. And again, make sure that you're not pulling your toe towards you. That you're doing all of the movement with the strap. So you;re muscles are nice and relaxed. They're just sitting there, they're enjoying the ride. Again, it should feel good. It should be one of those where, like it doesn't hurt, but if I push a little bit more it might hurt. So you're right at that point a lot of times when you're stretching as you go, you can feel the muscle let go a little bit. And then you can give it that extra stretch. Go ahead and relax again. And I didn't mention in the beginning, but I'll mention now, you never really want to stretch cold. Go ahead and pull again. So do a quick warm-up. You know 2-3 minutes just if you can do jumping jacks or just bringing your knees up. Getting those muscles nice and warmed up. I warmed up before I started. It doesn't have to be much, 2 - 3 minutes, but you need to really get those muscles loosened and warm before you start stretching and doing your exercises cause if you go cold, you're really not gonna get as much as a benefit cause those muscles are gonna be tight and it's gonna be really hard to stretch them out. So as long as you get that quick warm up, it should be pretty good. Ok, so now just kind of shake that out "
395,How can I do hamstring stretch using a strap for knee pain?,03:12,05:43,192,343,799,NkOwuoJCAuQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkOwuoJCAuQ,"or belt or towel, I like the straps or the dog leashes because you can kind of take that and then put it down low cause you want this to stay on nice and tight and now you're gonna lay down. Keep your leg as straight as you can, and start pulling it up. Go ahead and start that 30 second timer, and bring it up as far as you comfortably can without bending your knee. If you pull your toes up, you're gonna get a stretch in your calves as well. But what you should really be feeling for that hamstring stretch is that stretch right there it the back. So if you don't quite feel it, pull a little bit more or a lot of times people say they feel it more in their calves, then relax that foot a little bit, and that will take the calf out of it and then you can pull a little bit more. But the key is to keep that knee pretty straight. Take that little break. Relax it a little bit. And the reason it's important to stretch these muscles is because the hamstrings come down and cross the knee and the calf comes up and crosses the knee so if those are nice and loose, it helps protect that joint and not have so much pressure on it. So let's go back into a stretch again. Cause as you can see, a lot of time when you go back and feel behind your knees, you can feel things that feel like a little cord. There's some on this side and there's some on the inside. Those are those hamstring tendons, and if you feel all the way down, you can feel that they cross that knee. So when they're tight, they're pulling on that knee joint, and causing extra pressure in there which causes pain. So by having all those muscles nice and loose, you don't have all that stress on that joint which helps make everything nice and loose. Alright, coming down. Again in between, only needs to be about 10 seconds, it doesn't have to be anything big, but you do want to give it a quick break to kind of reset those muscles. And then we're gonna go into the third one now. Just again nice and stretched. Again, if you feel like your knee is starting to bend a little bit like that, that means you're pulling it up too much too quickly so then come back down cause you want it to be as straight as it can be. so if that's only to here, that's fine. If that's only to here, that's fine. But again, bring it up as much as you can where you're going alright that's a good hurt. Hurts so good kind of feeling, but not actually pain anywhere. I always like to keep the other knee up because then that takes some pressure off your back. Some people put it straight out, that's ok, you can. But I like to keep it bent so then you protect your back if you can. Alright, so then the next one is gonna "

I'm gonna do my right side so you can see it a little bit better, but stick to the same side that you're gonna do. Take that little loop again and put it all the way around to where your ankle is. Take that strap, that dog leash, that belt, and put it over your shoulder like this. So then you don't have to stress out your body. You can just relax going forward. And then start pulling it until you feel that stretch right on the front of your thigh area. So again, your goal is to get that heel as close to the bottom as you can. But not pushing through pain, just getting that nice tension on it. Now see I'm relaxed at my shoulder. Don't turn around and crank it, twist your back, make your back uncomfortable, really try and relax. I'm propped up on my elbows. If that's uncomfortable, just go ahead and lay down and relax. Because, again, you don't want to stretch something out and feel good in one area and then end up irritating something else and being uncomfortable. So make sure that your body is in a good position while you're stretching. So let's go into the second one. Nice pull. See I like these straps a lot cause they have the loops in between. So sometimes you can just grab in between there. Sometimes it takes a way from you having to grab hard on your fingers. If your fingers are uncomfortable, you can just take the loop and do a little pull. But again, you're relaxed, you're not trying to bring that heel actively to your bottom, your just relaxed and letting the strap do all the work. Just nice and relaxed. If you've got a book, I guess you could read a book if you wanted to. Alright. Come back down. We've got one more of those. Just a little pause in between. Shake it out if you need to. And then come on back up. So again, talking about why it's important to stretch that quad muscle. The quad muscle and tendon comes down and connects to the kneecap. So it's the same thing, if that muscle is tight, it pulls on that kneecap and if the kneecap isn't tracking properly, then that joint is going to cause a lot of pain. So having that quad muscle nice and loose, really helps take away some of that pain in the joint. A lot of times if people try and move their kneecap and it doesn't move, that usually means that your quad muscle and tendon are tight. Alright. Now you've "

Eventually you'll get to the point where your last 2 are very very challenging, but if this is the first time you're doing it, you don't want to do that. You just want to start getting everything moving and be comfortable. So taking that leg, putting it straight out, again. Now you're gonna actively pull your toes up, not with the strap, but actively. And that helps lock out the knee. You want your knee to be as straight as possible. The other knee is bent up so you can use it kind of as a target cause you don't want to bring the leg much higher than where this one is. Otherwise then you kind of take the exercise out of it. So just nice and slow come up to about where it's even, keep that leg nice and straight, and slowly come back down. So that's 1. 2. So see I'm doing kind of a smooth motion. Not really super fast. If you're going fast, that's using momentum, and taking the exercise out of it. But I'm not really relaxing at the bottom, I'm keeping those muscles tight the whole time. Let's do 2 more. And then nice and controlled, come back down and relax. If you have to take a break in between, that's fine. You can do that, but if you can, keep those muscles tight throughout the whole 10 exercises. Now turn over onto your side. Take the top leg, you can either prop it up behind, or you can prop it up in the front. Whatever's more comfortable for you. It's just kind of a balancer. The leg that's on the ground is the one that's you're working. So, again, kind of pull the toes up, to help lock out your leg. Keeping it nice and straight. And this time, you're just gonna come up off the ground. I like putting it behind, I feel like I have a better view of my leg to make sure it's straight. Cause you want to be in a very straight line. And you don;t have to bring it up high, Just lifting it, controlled up off the ground. Again, that's 3. And making sure that it's controlled the whole time. Up and down. Don't feel like you have to take it up this high cause then you're gonna have to modify things and move and use other muscles, and this one's using that inner thigh right there. So you should feel it right there. Let's do one more. Now I'm gonna keep on moving, but I'm gonna change sides, don't change sides, I'm just doing it so you can see the exercises. So now you're gonna roll over onto your stomach. So I'm gonna switch sides, again you stay with the same side. Still keeping that leg as straight as you can, sometimes your knee's gonna bend a little bit for this one, but if you can, pull those toes up and keep it nice and straight. And then just again, lift a little bit off the ground. Don't feel like you have to crank that up cause then you;re gonna pull your back a little bit and then you might be sore in your back. So just up and down. Nice and controlled. Doesn't have to be big, doesn't have to be fast. As long as you're controlling those movements. Squeeze those butt muscles if you can. That helps activate those glute muscles. And just 2 more and then coming all the way down. And then the last one, again you would be turning all the way around, is gonna be the top leg exercising. Some people like to just kind of bend up the bottom leg, whatever's comfortable for you, but again, you want your body to be in a straight line. If you're leg's coming forward, you're changing the muscles you're using and you want to use these outer muscles, you're glute med, your IT Band, your tensor fasciae latae, all those muscles up in here. And so again keeping the foot nice and straight, pulling up those toes. Almost leading with your heel, so it's not going this way, it's going up this way. But make sure you're keeping it in a straight line, or even slightly behind you so when you kick, go back just a little bit. Keep that knee straight. Keep the leg nice and straight, nice and controlled throughout the whole movement. You should feel a little burn through here, maybe even a little bit in your bottom. If you squeeze those glute muscles, that will help activate everything. And then nice and slow and smooth. One more of those. And then you're done. So it's as easy as that, just some simple stretches, some simple exercises to keep those muscles all around that knee nice and loose, nice "

All of those different ways essentially cause a bruise underneath your nail. And what will happen, and what will happen pretty rapidly, is that you'll see a little bit of blood underneath your nail, and your thumb or your finger will begin to throb. Well, if you're in a circumstance where you could go visit your medical provider, I would recommend that you do that because they would have equipment and strategies to help drain that blood blister from your nail in a very sterile and safe environment. But let's say that you are camping, and you're not going to be home until tomorrow. Or it's eight o'clock at night, and you really don't want to go to the emergency room. If you have to, if you can't get a medical provider to treat you, here is a home remedy. And what you do is you take a paper clip and undo it. And then you clean it. I would recommend that you clean it with soap and water, that you pour a little alcohol on it. The next thing that you want to do is you want to get the tip of it hot. So you can hold it in a flame, like in a candle flame, until it gets kind of red. And then what you're going to do is you're going to apply pressure onto the nail with the tip of this hot paper clip. And what will happen is you'll basically bore a little hole into the nail, and the blood that's trapped in there will release, and you'll have a fairly immediate relief in terms of pain. I would then bandage up that finger and make sure you treat it like a cut, that you keep it clean and dry. And if you don't still feel well the next day, if you feel there's more to come out, etc., or if any signs of infection occur, then you'll want to make sure that you see your physician as soon as possible.

424,How to loosen the neck muscles to help with a popping neck?,00:55,04:53,55,293,861,aHNH4yeXgQg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHNH4yeXgQg,right now this video is going to be broken up into three parts that all work together so go through all the parts and exercises and go with the exercises that offer the most amount of relief in the first part we're going to focus on muscle and tendon tightness especially ones that might be snapping with movement this is known as gua shot or muscle scraping and it might end up becoming your new favorite self-massage for the neck we need two things the first being a form of lubrication i'm going to be using coconut oil but you can also use massage creams or over-the-counter pain relief creams such as biofreeze or icy hot just make sure to coat the back of the neck shoulders upper back with the lubrication and when it comes to lubrication a little bit more is always better the next thing i'm going to be using is a metal spoon i like one that is a little bit thicker because you can just dig into the muscles a little bit more to hopefully get more relief so let's go through different motions that might be causing that popping or snapping into the neck and get those worked out i'm going to focus on basically doing a nice chin tuck like this while drawing my head forward to cause flexion into my neck so my chin down head is going forward like this and you're going to have to excuse me for my wolfman appearance because i haven't had a haircut in about a year what i want to do is i want to use my spoon and you can use your thumb and the spoon like this or you can use the edge right here i prefer the edge but it's your choice and go over the muscles only so we're staying off any bony parts including the spine base of the skull and we're not going to go over the front of the neck start at the top part of the upper back right here put a little bit of pressure in there and do a nice slow stroke up towards the base of the skull go lightly until you find your comfort level you just want to do this very lightly and very slowly and just move over just a little bit and continue all the way across the back side of the neck when you do this you're also going to notice that a certain spot might feel very gritty make note of that that's generally a spot of adhesion and just put a little bit more pressure in there to try to break it up you might also notice red pockets start to form that is blood flow coming to the area that will help promote healing but once you go across one side always switch to the other to make sure that you're keeping both in balance from there what you're going to do is just attack it at a different angle let's go down with it instead and repeat and then from there go at a 45 degree angle also explore using different parts of the spoon maybe it feels more effective to use the rounded part maybe it feels better to use the tip but just go with the one that you feel is the most effective from there what you want to do is go through motions that might be causing that popping or snapping sound let's say that i get a lot when i turn my head towards the left let's go into that position and i'm starting to feel that popping click right here so i'm going to go through the motion but i'm at the same time going to start to dig in there with the spoon but just try to attack it with different movements go up and down with it go side to side you can also use different parts of the spoon try to release as much tension as possible until it feels like you're able to move the head without that clicking sound and you can repeat this up and down and in different motions another good way to really target the neck is to do a neck retraction that's taking two fingers going back as far as you're able to and then really digging into those muscles also if you want to target more into the top part of the shoulder this is how we can do that let's take our hand put it on one side and take the ear towards the shoulder this will open up the other side especially that trapezius muscle that runs down into the shoulder that allows you to really just dig in there and focus on the muscle that goes from the top part of the neck all the way down into the shoulder and again just repeat on the other side but just again go very lightly with it don't go over the front part of the neck no bony parts and really just focus on the spots with certain movements and different angles and hopefully you'll get a lot of those popping sensations out

So basically you're going to pull your head over and straighten your arm out and then come back in. Try to keep your head in a straight forward position, don't turn towards it, but keep it straight ahead, and then just side bend over and follow that hand going down and coming back up.

So for the trap stretch, if I'm stretching my right side, I'm going to put my hand down. Some people put it behind their back you can do that. If you're sitting in a chair, it helps to kind of grab on the bottom of the chair cause then that kind of stabilizes the shoulder because you don't want your shoulder coming up, you want it to stay down. And then take your opposite hand and then just pull away and hold that stretch for 30 seconds. So you should feel that stretch right in through there, and just nice hold. See if I'm not holding on that shoulder comes up a little bit, and I'm it's not terrible but then I'm not getting quite as much of a stretch, so make sure you kind of pull it down, you can just take your fist and push it down as well. Holding that for 30 seconds and then doing that three times. If you want to do both sides you can as well. "

The other characteristic you want to look for is changing, so an area that's changing more than the rest of your body.

What people should look for is something that says broad spectrum. And that implies that both UVA and UVB  is being quieted. It depends on the organization if you're going to wear sunscreen probably it's a 15 to a 30 that you want to apply. One reason why the FDA capped the labeling at 50 is at about an SPF of 50 you're blocking essentially 97 to 98 percent of the UV that's out there. So rather than say oh, I'm good for the day because I have an SPF of 5000, it's oh it's a 50 and oh yeah the label says every two hours to reapply it. It's not waterproof because that term doesn't exist anymore in the labeling. It should say water resistant and also give guidelines as to how often sunscreen or sun blocks are reapplied. "

First one is, uh, just working that hand and getting it moving, uh, throughout the day is gonna be helpful. Typically in the morning it's gonna be more painful. Do what you can. If you can pop through that, painful spot and open up and pop through it, you can do that, if it's too painful, just do range of motion in the pain-free range. - Yeah, don't get it fired up. - Right. - But, uh, do you want to mention, Brad, that sometimes you'll find the tender spot down here, and you can actually hold on to that while your doing range? - I was gonna, I was gonna tell'em that later! - Oh, okay. Sorry. I jumped in. - We're gonna get back to that. - Okay. - So, active range of motion first and do that, you know, 10-20 repetitions in the pain-free range, and then also range the finger arc to the end range. - Gotcha. - Okay, so mine was my middle finger or the third digit, so, when you open it up, push just that finger. That's the end range. Stretch it that way 5-10 repetitions and then go the other way, you're gonna have to go through the trigger part and then push it down. This way is the more painful side. If this really flared up, a week ago I wouldn't have been able to do this without saying bad words, uh, but I can do it now. It's comfortable, but I have been doing this as well, and you can do that 2-3 times per day. You're not gonna want to do that all the time. - Sure. - Because it's just too aggressive. "

Yeah, I'm doing it this way because that's actually the finger that I've worked on, and what I did is I used my thumb here and I take my hand and hold on to the back, and then I would use this thumb, and then I would, I actually, instead of, we talked about cross friction, going across, I did all directions. - Yeah, and that's what I would recommend too. - Yeah. - Absolutely in all directions. - This is really incredible, because I'm pushing pretty hard without much pain and just three or four days ago when I started this, this was not comfortable. - Yeah, you want to find the tender spot basically. - Yep. - And, and , and you start off, you know, initially, you have to do it lightly. - Yep. - And then over time, you can work it to be more aggressive. - Right, um, if this is, if your trigger finger's really flared up to begin with and this really hurts, just don't do it, you may want it... - Let it calm down. - Yep. You may want to put a cold pack on it, maybe do some ibuprofen if that works for you, um, but as this improves, I am just happier and happier that I can work this. It's wonderful Bob! - Yeah, so what I was mentioning before. - Oh yes, another option. - Is that you can actually find that tender spot sometimes, and, and then do range and it just seems like it helps, guide that pulley through the system there. Um. - So if you do this and it triggers and it clicks, if you push on it and then, as a result of that pressure you can go through the range of motion. - See, see if you can. - Yep. - See if it makes it better. If it doesn't, it's not worthwhile doing. - But if it does. - If it does, that's the way to do it. - Yep, work that as well. Remember, you gotta get that knot outta there, get it smooth again. Um.

If you look at the stripes, we're going to see if it's straight. And the good thing to do is just compare one to the other. If one doesn't go down as far, you can also put your foot out. - Brad put this one up a little bit so that you can see the difference. Let's say... - Like that? - Yeah. And you can see that one just doesn't go as straight. - You can do it. It's nice to have a rolling stool. You could do it on a stationary one and check 'em this way too.

And I don't see anybody else's recommending this, but I highly recommend it for this reason. And by the way, here's the kneecap, and right below is the tendon. So here's your kneecap, right here is the tendon. And you just take one finger, and put it on top of the other, and rub across it like this really hard. And now if you're having pain there, by the way, maybe you don't have Osgood-Schlatter. Pain- Osgood-Schlatter is the pain a little bit below or on the bump. - Uh-hmm. - This might be more of a tendonitis. But what this will do is this will stretch the tendon, prior to competition, prior to you working out. And it'll put just a little bit less stress on the bone then. - Sure. - And it'll also get more blood flow to it. - So it's warming up. - So you're gonna do that for a couple minutes. - Couple minutes. - And your fingers are gonna get tired, eventually. - Yeah. - If you do that, it's very tender, and it continues to hurt, and it creates a lot of pain, then you probably wanna avoid it. - Yeah. - But after about 30 seconds to a minute, it should start to feel a little bit better, maybe even a little numb. Then you know, you're right on. - Right. "

So you can go right from that into the second treatment for second way to manage Osgood-Schlatter, which is you are gonna have to warm up, and you're gonna have to warm up more than any of your classmates or teammates, or anything like that. You gotta really emphasize 'cause you really wanna make sure the muscles are as stretched as far as possible and warmed up as far as possible. So the first thing you wanna make sure, especially, you wanna make sure you're stretching the quadriceps. - Right. So, let's check that out. (wheel rolling) (chair scraping) - So to stretch the quadriceps, there's a lot of ways to do it. But what I like just the standing way, and you can grab the ankle, or if you can grab the foot by the opposite, but I just grab the ankle like this and I pull back. - Right. - Like this, keep a good posture. And right here, if you want to add a little twist to it, then you tilt your pelvis down. - Sure. - Can you show what tilt down means, Brad? - So it's going back this way. - Yeah. - And you'll find it. You'll feel that stretch right there more when you pull this knee back this way, and keep your shoulder- - Yeah. - Look, you got a little string on your shirt. What the heck? (Bob laughing) We can't have that on our video. Anyways, so here we go. We're gonna stretch that out. You're gonna get a good hip flex to stretch it out. - Yeah. And that quadriceps. You can do this laying down too, which is a little more comfortable, depending. And I kind of like doing this just 'cause you can relax. I can relax more, anyways. And again, it's like- - [Bob] Yeah. And then stretch. - And then if you push up a little bit here, you'll get some more stretch. That's just another option. - [Bob] It's you know, it's very important that you do that stretch. The hamstring stretch is important to, you know, where we just, you can find a wall, or something that's about this height. - Yeah. - Keeping good posture. Just gonna lean forward. That's about as far as I can go, Brad. - Knee straight. - Yeah. - Don't. - Yeah. If you let the knee bend, - Yeah. That's not- - We're cheating. - Yeah, that's cheating. (Brad chuckles) So good long stretch on both of those. "

And that's strengthening it while you're it is lowering down, basically. - Sure. - So what you're gonna do is you're gonna start off, and you're gonna lower yourself onto a chair, like this. And then you can go up with both legs and then again, lower yourself onto a chair. - Okay. - You would even work better working with lower chair because they're lower, (chair screeching). - Right. And It'll be easier on here. If it's too painful to do this, then you should go on a higher surface. (Bob laughing) - I couldn't. I couldn't lower myself all the way down. - Yeah.

You probably can do that. - You're gonna be able to do this easier with better balance than us people over 50. - So, and then you can do, you know, slow sidestepping, braiding, retro ambulation. All these things very slowly to get the muscles warmed up. - Right. - And kind of some of that dynamic stretching. - Yeah. So you're gonna do these warmups before you get out to ready to do your full sprints, or, you know, whatever your activity is. "

The other thing then, the third treatment, for Osgood-Schlatter, category basically, is how do you decrease the pain? So one thing after every event, after every athletic event, every practice, I want you to ice it. And a quick way to ice is to actually just take a styrofoam cup and fill it with water. - Yeah. - Put it in your freezer. And after it's frozen, you just tear off the top to get down to the ice. And I usually put my hand on to smooth out the ice a little bit. - Yeah. - And then you can just go ahead and put it on there, and rub it until it gets numb. And you know that way it's not gonna take that long to cool it down. - Right. You can do it right on the bone. - Usually about five minutes. - Five, yeah, five minutes or less, but- - Put a towel under your leg, otherwise you'll get a wet floor, and your mom will get mad at you. - That's right.

(chairs scraping) This is something you have to trial with and see how it works. But they're not real expensive. If it's not effective, it's not a big loss. This one, they call 'em a Cho-Pat, but that's just a manufacturer. There's other companies that make it. It's kinda like a rope, with inside the strap. So there's a bump there to ridge, and you put that right above the bump over that 10 and that hollow spot, below the kneecap and that bump. And then you just simply... - Strap it. - Pretty tight. - Tight, yeah. Strap it. A little tight there and give that a whirl. - And the idea is that you're taking some of the stress off that bump. And now instead of the tendon pulling on the bump, it's pulling right here. - Right. - That's the idea. - Right. - Now, I think the effectiveness is of this is questionable. - Right. - But I would try it. It's worth a try. And you can actually tape this way. You can, there's a taping method even - for doing this, but- - Sure. - It's- Yeah, if it doesn't work, you're not out a lot of money.

So the first thing you're gonna do and this is one you can probably start off with almost immediately is the straight leg raises. - Sure. - Cause you're not putting a a great deal of stress on it. - Right. Right. - So you're gonna show those Brad. - You bet. - [Bob] Straight leg raises times three. - Okay. So this is the leg that we're working with. I always like to keep the opposite leg bent and up in this position and it gives a little more stability and we're just gonna keep the knees straight. If you can, if it comes up and it goes like this and you can't keep it straight it's probably not ready for it yet. - [Bob] Right. - So you're here and up and down. Good control up. - [Bob] Yep. - Good control down and up to about a 45. Is that what you say, Bob? - [Bob] I would say. Yep. - And - [Bob} and that's for the hip Flexion. - Right. - [Bob] And some quad probably. Yeah. - Right. - Again, it's early on but it's good to get that quadricep so that, you know you can keep the knee straight and you really need to keep the knee straight for the whole ten of them before you'd go to the next exercise. - [Bob] Probably a good three to five seconds going up Brad. - Oh, a slow good. Yeah. - [Bob] Yeah. Probably really slow. You really wanna slow and controlled here. - Sure. - [Bob] On this one. Normally we can do it that fast, But on this one you want to keep, keep slow. - And even on a healthy quadic I can feel 'em working. It's amazing. - [Bob] Yeah. What a difference it makes. - Yeah. It's a yep. - [Bob] All right then abduction? - I'll do it facing this way cause of my back. - [Bob] Yep, I would say. - Okay, so now would be. We're doing ab or add? - [Bob] Ab. - Ab. Okay. So I keep the bottom one and then I'm gonna go. - The bottom was, is bent and again he's keeping and you wanna keep over onto your side. You don't wanna lean this way too far or too far this way. There you go. And again, three to five seconds, Brad nice and controlled - And watch where my toe is. It's good now. But if you find yourself doing this. - Yeah, you're cheating. - That's cheating. Get it over like this. - Toes point to the side. To the wall. 1001, 1002, 1003. These are hard. Aren't they? - [Brad] Oh yeah. Now this isn't working the quad a lot. It is working more up here but you need to work the whole leg. - Right. - So we're not - That's working the IT band a little bit here so. - [Brad] Yep. - And then abduction is the last one. Brad, I'm gonna watch your mic on that one, but - Yep. I'm wearing front. So now we're gonna work the muscles on the inner thigh. This one's not doing work stabilizing. I need to get over more. I'm gonna squish my mic hold or something gonna cheat a little bit there for that reason and whoop - [Bob] Same thing, keep, you know, three to five seconds and keeping the toe straight forward. - Just do it on each side? - And again, these are much harder when you do 'em than what you're seeing. If you haven't done 'em - [Bob] Right. - Especially when you do 'em slow. Good control with good mechanics. - [Bob] Harder for me, Brad, cuz I got long legs. - Sure. "

The next thing I do I do like to put a little bit of a stretch on the muscle. - Yep. - And, and you can kind of do that. You know, you can do it this way. I'm stretching. This is the one I have trouble with actually. And you can stretch, I'm stretch a little hip flexer but I'm getting the quad here too. - Right. - But you can also, and again you keep good posture, and just a real gentle stretch. Don't bounce at all on this one. - Right. - You're just wondering. - Yeah there. - You just wanna keep stretch. - I think there's some people that say don't stretch a you know, torn muscle.

Now you can start off with, just take a two by four. This is not two by four. This is what two, two by sixes? One by sixes? - [Brad] They're one by fours. I would think for that. So we're gonna have three inch and a half high. Yeah. And you can go higher actually, if - [Brad] Sure. - If you want, but I dunno if you can catch that Lonnie or not. - [Lonnie} A little Bit. - I'll put it all the way back here. And this is just gonna make it a lot easier to stay in control. But you put your heels on there and let's say this is the trouble, the one I'm having trouble with. So you're gonna go ahead and you're gonna lower yourself down and you're gonna sit way back. Like you're sitting on a chair cuz you're trying to make sure the knee stays over the toes. - Sure. - Not beyond the toes. You wanna show Brad? - Yep. - Yeah, I gotta board right here. If I put a board down if I go like this I'm going way in front of the toes. - Right. - I wanna stay back like this. - You can see it's like you're doing a squat with weights on, but no, no bar over your shoulders. - Okay. Now the thing is you want to do three to five seconds going down and three to five seconds going up. actually you probably just wanna do eccentric to start off with. So what what we're gonna do is I'm gonna show you this too though by the way, I'm getting ahead of myself here, Brad. - I can see that. It's alright. - All right. What I'm gonna do is first. I wanna make sure you're not going knees in. - Right. - And I wanna make sure you're not going knees out. - Right. - You're keeping 'em straight over the toes. - Right - Okay. - And then how far you go down is gonna be by how far you are in the rehab you don't. - Right. You may wanna start off real shallow. - Right. - And the second thing is you probably wanna start off with what we call eccentric strengthening. So I'm strengthening this one. So on the way down, you can even lean a little bit more on this one and go down on this one - The injured one. - The injured one. And then going up, you can lean over onto the right and push up with the right one. - Sure. Yep. - Brad, you had also mentioned that you people could use a cane. You could go down like this and have been push up. - Right. Just for some balance, take some stress off the, - Or a chair. - Sure. - You could push up with a chair. If you have both legs that are given you trouble then you have to have two chairs set up so that you can push up on the way up. - Sure. - So again, three to five seconds down, push up. You can squeeze your butt a little bit too. - sure. - As you get up again. - Again no sharp pains. If you got sharp pains, it's too early for you. - Yep. The one though that I have found that worked better than this, Brad is if you wanna invest into a physio ball, what else you call these exercise ball? - Exercise, ball, physio ball. - This worked much better for me. It just was a lot easier for me to do. - Sure. - It's I can, I can keep my toes way out like this. And I just slowly went down like this. Brad. I'm just really in control. - Keeping the same mechanics the same rules. - It's just so easy to stay in control here with this. - Right. - I, I just, I like this so much better. - And even with the ball, depending on, you know you might use a cane you know that you could hold for balance. - Right. - If you haven't used it before. - If you wanna do eccentric, just do eccentric. You can go down like this or you can lean to the right going up and take the pressure off of it. - Sure. - So I'm putting the pressure on the left one on the way down then I'm putting the pressure on the right one on the way up. - Yep. - That's what I've been doing at home. - Yeah. That, that's a good, good technique. - So. - I like that. - Eventually, if you're a heavy duty athlete and a heavy duty weightlifter you may want to go, this is our simulates, our big bar. - Right. You bet. - These are, these are each 45 pounds. - Yep. Big. Yeah. These are those titanium plates you can see through. - Right. So anyway, what you're gonna wanna do is you're gonna eventually can do some squats. If you know the proper technique for squats you can put some heavy weight on you and you can just do some real slow squats. And that's supposed to be actually very good for a quadricep tendonitis or tear if you're ready for that phase of it. - Right. - So. - That's near the end of the rehab. - Now how often now if you're doing like the ball on the wall and stuff like that, you can do that every day. You can even do it twice a day. That's how often you can do it. - You're not gonna get too aggressive. You gotta let your body rehab. I guess it's an individual thing. - It is. That's a very good point, Brad, because you you gotta listen to your body - Sure. Right. - And see how it's doing. - Right. - But if you're doing squats I wouldn't do those more than twice a week. - Yeah. - Heavy squats. - You're right. Exactly. - Right. But you're exactly right. Brad, this is all experiment for you gotta figure out what works for your body. - Right. - I found out that this worked better for me than than doing it on the board. - Right. - Maybe other people are gonna like the board better. - Sure.

524,How can I put TENS/EMS unit for tennis elbow pain relief?,08:12,11:22,492,682,731,wEfiJL-JS_4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEfiJL-JS_4,"nice about that is let's say your elbow pain is the whole elbow. so maybe it's tennis elbow. maybe it's golfer's elbow. maybe it's just the whole elbow hurts. so four electrodes would be better because you can kind of get more area with the four electrodes. so what I would do with that is when you have four you want each channel to cross. so if I have this first channel, I want it to be one on this side and one on that side, but I don't want them just to be here and then them there because then they're not going to cross and get that whole area. so I would just kind of get the whole general area kind of here and then cross the one up on top maybe over here. and then same thing that I would take the channel to with the other electrodes and now cross it the other way. so then I'm getting that cross channel. so it's really getting that whole elbow area and the cool thing with ten's is the placement doesn't have to be exact. when you're doing the EMS, it should be a little bit more exact because you're going on the muscle belly, but with the tens, you're really just trying to get the general area for the pain. so you can see here once again these are crossing and then these are crossing here. so when you turn it back on, you want to go back to the tens settings and that's usually those those first ones, and then just start bringing it. and so again you really shouldn't be having a contraction in there, and so it should be comfortable you know a little bit slightly uncomfortable, but not painful. you know this is to really just kind of get everything nice and relaxed, so that would be the way you do it. now let's say you wanted to get a little bit more specific you know maybe if it was this time the golfer's elbow, it would still be the same setup on the outside, but we're gonna go with the golfer's elbow on the inside here. so I'm just going to take one channel off and then use the other channel, find which one that was, and then use the other one to get that specific area. so if I wanted to get a little more specific, let's say it was hurting right there, so this time if you're just using one channel with two electrodes and they're a little bit closer this will make it a little bit stronger. so that's really just going to be a little more concentrated into that area. so if it's hurting here, I want that one channel just to be talking to each of those electrodes back and forth like that. and then so same thing you just kind of start bringing it up. now you can see here, see what's happening? I'm not doing that it's kind of pulling forward because I've got it just in a little bit of a spot where is picking up that nerve. so all you have to do is just take take the power back down a little bit, and just move it a little bit in a different spot. so that was probably just hitting that ulnar nerve a little bit and getting that going. so then you just move it and then start over again, and see so now now it's not doing that, but I'm feeling that TENS vibration going and "

You can take your fingers and put one by the other or you can put one on top of the other and you're going to go right and find that tender spot, usually off the bone a little bit, and going right over the tendon. - And you'll know if you get on the really tender spot, this is going to hurt like the Dickens. So you need to get away from it. - Get away from it a little bit - And go this direction more towards, more on the muscle. - Now Brad's using his thumb there, which should work for the angle. You can also use the fingers. Now you're going to really dig in fairly deep and the fibers run this way. So you're going to go across the fiber. That's why it's called a cross fiber friction massage. Applying some friction there. So you start massaging and if after 30 seconds to 60 seconds, it's just too tender, it just keeps getting worse and worse and worse, in that case, I'm going to have you try massage number two "

And you know, you can have a little pain with it, but like Bob said, you know, after 30 seconds or a little more it should plateau or even start to feel better. And then you can move a little closer. So you got to find that happy medium. But if it's just too painful and it hurts and it's getting worse, then you got to back up and get into the muscle. - Yeah, get into the muscle belly, work the belly and see if you can loosen up that belly. I'm going to show you one other thing you can do on the tendon, too. But that would definitely be something you can do. And that you can go directly into, right, Brad? - Yep, then you can work at.

Do this just 10 times. - So with your thumb, you can feel the muscles contract. - You can feel the tendon. I'm right on the tendon.

You're into your side. - Yep. Right there. - You're stretching it palm out. You're stretching and palm in. - So you're not grabbing the hand. You're grabbing the wrist and try to get a good hold of that. - So I'll show you on the left side now I'm going to grab the wrist. I'm going to take it palm out and then take it palm in. - So we've got flat here and still there.

And see he's bringing the shoulder blades together. He's strengthening the core, what we like to call the core of the shoulder.

The first thing that you're going to do is to hang off of a doorframe or a bar at the gym. Hanging from a bar or a doorframe is safe for pretty much all types of back pain so this is why I suggest you start with this one first. The reason why you're going to hang is because in your in your spine the hanging is going to create a pulling sensation on the intervertebral discs. So if you have a disc bulge or a disc prolapse then that pulling is going to almost create a suction type mechanism which could potentially pull some of that disc prolapse or disc bulge back in and thus reducing the extent of the disc prolapse. So reach up grab a bar drop your knees down and just allow your lower back and abdominal region to relax and from this position just continue to breathe but allowing your pelvis to drop. Another really simple but effective stretch and mobilization is what they 
553,How to perform the cat and cow yoga pose for lower back pain relief?,03:17,04:49,197,289,626,hbdK1kC_KyI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbdK1kC_KyI,Another really simple but effective stretch and mobilization is what they call in yoga the cat and cow you're going to start by coming down onto your hands and knees place your hands underneath your shoulders and your knees are underneath your hips so you're in an all fours position. Make sure your spine is neutral so it's neither overly flexed or overly extended. Once your comfortable in that position take a deep breath in and as you breathe in look up towards the ceiling and push your belly down so that your lower back is bending. Once you've taken another deep breath in breathe out and as you breathe out drop your head down lift your lower spine as much as you can almost like someone's got a piece of string on your back and is lifting it up once you've fully exhaled take another deep breath in and as you do that lift your head up again pushing your belly down. The reason I think this is a good exercise to do is because it causes movement throughout the lower back which makes the muscles of your lower back the erector spinae contract and relax which helps to push blood through the muscles and allows better drainage of the blood and any inflammation helps to push it away. I suggest doing this about five to ten times really slowly and just focusing on the speed of your breath rather than trying to get through the movement The 
554,How to stretch the hip and butt muscles for lower back pain relief?,04:49,06:35,289,395,626,hbdK1kC_KyI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbdK1kC_KyI,"next really important stretch is for your hips and buttocks and you can do this while you're at the office or at home or anywhere that's seated. You can also do another variation which is lying down on the floor which I'll show you afterwards. So if you're at work and you're sat down on a chair and perch on the edge of your chair, put one leg on top of the other knee, hold your shin with both hands and then use your elbow to push that knee down. If you want to increase that stretch you can lean forwards into it but most people will find that this is enough just by putting a hand or an elbow on that top knee and pushing down. One thing I would just point out to you guys is don't put your foot on your knee because that's going to put a lot of stress through your ankle which will make your ankle ligaments start to become over stretched. So make sure that ankle is well over your planted knee. From here grab your knee, lift your knee up and over so now you should be feeling a stretch through your buttocks. When I do these stretches on myself I like to do each stretch for about 20 seconds alternating into the other one about 20 seconds, alternate back and keep repeating every other 20 seconds. I find that this helps to keep it a bit looser almost like it's pumping blood through the area and almost a bit like exercising it rather than just purely stretching it. If you're a bit "

Cross your legs then with it whichever one you want on top of your bottom leg and then either using your hand or your elbow push that knee down and hold. After about 20 seconds grab your knee and pull it up and over the other way. Now some people find that this stretch is too hard to get into so one way of working around it is to put one leg straight across your other leg over and then do the same thing.

So in my opinion the best way of stretching your hamstrings is to have a soft bend in the knees. Now if you're really tight to begin with then have one leg bent. From here bend the other leg keep your chest up and your back straight. Now when you come to bend forwards you're gonna try and push your belly forward onto your thigh. Like this . That's

So, what you wanna do, number one, you wanna avoid sleeping on this shoulder. - Right, right. - If you can. So what you're gonna do, I'm asleep on my side here, by the way, these are my actual pillows, because, Brad, you're probably gonna have to pan down here. - Oh, yeah! Do you sleep with your eyes closed, Bob? - What? (laughs) - I was just curious. - It's funny that you should say that, because my wife often claims I don't. - [Brad] Oh, I can just imagine. - So, anyway, I'm gonna sleep on my side, these are my actual pillows, so what I do is, this is my throw pillow that I use. - [Brad] Oh, you've mentioned that one many times over the last couple years. - Yeah, I'll show that in a minute, I don't need that right now. But I got two pillows on my side, and then actually here's my sleep evasion pillow too, by the way. So I'm gonna use all these pillows here, I sleep on my side like this. And so, this is the painful arm, and then you're gonna put a pillow here, but the key is to put another pillow on top of it to give it support. Otherwise the arm is down, and curled around like this, all night long, and that's pinching that nerve even more. - [Brad] You could stretch it a little bit too. - Right, you can also sleep with just putting the arm up on your body like this, that's a good position for it too. But it's more comfortable, it might be better to go this way actually, you put this pillow underneath the arm like that. Alright, I'm gonna show, let's say you're just stubborn, like we are, and you're gonna sleep on that shoulder no matter what. In that case, then you need the throw pillow. And you've seen this maybe many times in other videos, you're gonna create the canal here. And so I'm gonna get my two pillows here, and this creates a canal, I'm gonna be careful with my mic, but this takes pressure, now the pressure is on my ribcage and my head, not so much on my shoulder. - [Brad] What about your feet? You gotta get them back on there. - Well, I'm just tryin' to go halfway on here. - [Brad] I'm just ribbin' you anyway. - That'll help you with sleeping. "

So when you're in your recliner, you may wanna take again, a throw pillow like this, and it'll help give you some support in the low back and put your body into a better position, the better the position the neck is in, the less stress there's gonna be on the nerve.

Good point, Brad. So when you're sleeping on your back, it's gonna be the same thing here, I'm gonna sleep, usually with one pillow, you wanna thin pillow or just one. - Thin, thin pillow. - So, I'm gonna sleep on my back, heck I'm gonna put one underneath of my legs. This is what I do here, I put one here again, and one here like this, and again, nice and supported. How's that look Brad? - That pillow, it always drives me nuts when people have their pillow under their shoulders. - I know, I'm just trying, I'm watching my mic. - [Brad] I know, I know, I just wanted to clarify. - The big idea is to get the arm supported like that. But these are not minor things. If you're irritating your neck all day long, and all night long, it's not gonna go away. Once you pinch that nerve it's gonna get flared up. "
560,How to perform towel extensions to relieve pain from a pinched nerve?,06:07,10:14,367,614,849,drP_sp-nPog,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drP_sp-nPog,"- Right, exactly. - So how about we start with extensions? Usually that's the one we're gonna start with. You wanna grab the towel? - [Brad] Oh, you bet. - Now, with most people, when they start off, I thought you were gonna do it? - Oh, yeah, okay. - With most people, when they start off, usually it's extension what we're gonna have 'em do, and with extension, usually, you wanna share or what or what do you wanna do? With extension usually it hurts to do it without a towel. So we have most people start with a towel. - Yeah, so going back like this goes, ow, it hurts right about halfway back and oftentimes it may, if it goes down the arm, then you really know you've got a pinched nerve, that is pinching it more. So what we're gonna do is, we'll start out with a little chin tuck, get the towel around the base, and get it so it's rolled up a little bit thicker, is usually comfortable at first. And you can lean right back in the chair to relax your shoulders, chin tuck, and gently go back until you feel that pinch, and then come forward and you can kinda pull forward, you're not pulling hard on the towel, just support. - [Bob] And Brad, you might actually, if you're in the same case with me as I am, with the right arm, on the right pain, you might just use one arm to pull on the towel, and let this one relax. - You could even... - Yeah, and that's a good point by the way, this is another thing I want you to do, is throughout the day is, I want you to go ahead and put a pillow underneath your arm whenever you sit in a chair. Under the arm on the painful side, because that can actually help, again, also take away, oh you can't even see that, there we go. That'll help take away the stresses on the nerve as it's pulling on the neck. - And as it goes further and further back... - [Bob] Eventually you might get to the point where you don't need the towel anymore. But for most people, it seems that they need it to start off with. - You wanna get here, Bob? And we'll show what happens to the symptoms? - Yup, I'm gonna put this back up again and flip it. This is like old school, Brad and I used to do this all the time. We used to not have a camera person when we first started off. So, if the towel is working, the extension is working, you should start, what you wanna see is that the pain that's furthest away from your neck starts to be relieved first. So if this resembles the pain, boom, gone, it's no longer in my hand, the numbness or the tingling, it's not necessarily just the pain, let's say the tingling even gets better. You know, look for something that's making it better. Then the next step would be, hopefully, the pain's gonna go out of the upper-lower arm. (chuckles) So you see now, now I'm not having any symptoms in my hand or my forearm, that's golden, that means you're doing the right thing. Now those exercises, though, you must realize this, they aren't just done once a day. You're doin' them like every hour, maybe five to eight times a day, 10 repetitions, y'know doing 10 times, and that's where you're gonna start getting some results. - And you have to continue to monitor your posture, no head forward posture, slipping sleeping pillow, no recliner with your head forward on a pillow behind it, those things have to be maintained. - So the next thing would be, hopefully, as it starts to improve, you can actually see the pain leave the upper arm, and... - Why don't you turn so they can see this? Stand up. (chuckles) - I don't know if I can stand up. - 'Cause of it's cut your head off. - Is there anything left? - Yeah, that's fine. So right here, the pain'll be here, even as the pain's getting better in the arm, if it's starting to hurt a little bit more up by the shoulder and the neck, that is okay. As long as the pain is gone from further down the arm. They call it centralizing McKenzie technique, and as it gets better then, actually, it all the way goes away and you're feeling pretty darn good by this time. "

We're gonna chin tuck, and then we're gonna sideways flex towards the side of pain. So if the pain's on this side, you're gonna chin tuck and go to that side. Chin tuck, and go to that side, and you're gonna see if that's gonna help take away the pain. This is always an experiment, we're tryin' to figure out what it is as far as tips, and exercises, what takes away the pain, especially if it takes it away down here first, and then starts centralizing up so that you no longer have it in the entire arm. - So this one, you bend to side, that doesn't mean you should grab and pull hard. Just the movement is typically all you need to assess that. "

So Brad's showing it from the side, I'm showing it from the front. Just this is kind of the warm up, and you can do these throughout the day. One thing I'd forgotten is that, prior to doing the extension, you might wanna do some chin tucks. Because that'll warm up the neck, and it's kinda putting the neck in the right position. You're gonna go ahead and tuck the chin in, you're not going down, you're not going up, you're just bringing it straight back.

And he would do these 10 times every hour, a set of 10, and it was miraculous, Brad. - So his arm pain and symptoms improved. - Yeah, within two days. - Oh. - It was very much improved, and within a week it was pretty much gone. - Sure. - No, it doesn't always go that way, unfortunately, but you like these small miracle wins that show up in the clinic once in a while. - Yes, you bet.

And you can do the W's here as well, hand back in here with some chin tucks, all the same basic movements. - And again, pain-free. - Yep. And then one thing, and I was just doing this with my wife 'cause she was having some issues with pain down her arm, and you can put the roll this way. Now, if you have a foam roller that's a softer one, like this blue one, they're more comfortable to do this. This is all you do, you just hang out here for 15 to 30 seconds. Now I've done this after exercise, I'll just hang out here for 3-5 minutes and just relax and close my eyes. But you gotta have the softer roller, otherwise it's a little uncomfortable. The black ones are hard density, the colored ones are typically the softer ones. - It's kinda the lazy man's way to posture there. - Yeah. - Just lay down there and let it stretch, let gravity do its' thing. - I'm tellin' ya, Bob, you give the lazy person how to do a task and it'll be the easiest way. - That's right, they'll figure out the best way to do it, that's right.

I like pulling up my toes because that just kind of helps lock out everything and activate all the muscles. again you want to go slow with this. you don't want to go super fast, but you're just coming up to about the height of the other knee and then slowly coming down. so you're not coming all the way up like that because in most of time you're using momentum to do it. really control that movement, get about to there, and then slowly come back down. some people do ask can I put the other leg down. you can, but a lot of times that puts a little bit of stress on your low back. so if it's if it's comfortable to do this propped up, really prop it up because it also gives you a target about how high you should take it up. so again ten times, you know two to three sets, a couple times a day. if this becomes easy and then you get up to 20-25 it's really easy, you can put a little ankle weight around your ankle. so then we're gonna go into "

I'm gonna prop up on my elbow. you don't have to prop up on your elbow, make sure you're comfortable, make sure you're not hurting something else while you're doing it. so if you want to lie all the way down that's fine. I just find it easier to talk to you with my elbow propped up. but make sure if you prop up on your elbow that your elbows pretty in alignment with your shoulder so you don't end up hurting your shoulder. the key to this is your hips should be perpendicular to the floor. so if you're lifting your leg and you're rolling back like that, you're not getting the work that you really want to do. so this you'll probably feel more in your gluteus medius and those glutes muscles, but these have a lot to do with the knee. so if you're getting these stronger, your knees gonna feel better. keep your feet together. you don't want to lift up your your foot, but you're just lifting up your top knee without rolling back. so you're just coming up. again you don't have to come very high, and then nice and control back down. so if I'm doing this and my hips are rolling back, that's not quite right because then you're not really working those muscles. so it doesn't, you don't have to lift it high, you just have to get it controlled and keep those hips perpendicular. so again just starting off with ten, two sets of ten, if you can get up to fifteen twenty to twenty five, and it's easy, then you can wrap one of those loop bands for resistive bands around and then give yourself a little bit resistance. if both knees hurt make sure you're doing both sides for all of these. so now we're "

If you never done these before, what I have found, what you're doin is press ups. You put your hands beneath your shoulders. And what I find, people that are maybe a little older and they haven't done these is they actually push up like this and their whole body goes up with it. - Yeah. - 'cause they're so tight. - It's no good. - There's no movement. I just have them do like baby, you call them baby press ups, right? - Sure. - Baby press ups. And have them work in to it. You might do this, you know, direction for a week or so.

You know, if you get up to this height even, that's really good. - And with these, 10, no more than ten is needed. You know, five to 10 is a good, and if you got shoulder problems and that does irritate your shoulder, then that's an issue. You can't do it.

So the first thing you want to do is hopefully if you need crutches, you get a pair of the newer ones that are aluminum and they are much more easily adjustable. - Oh they are. Yeah, as opposed to the unscrew? - Right, the wooden ones where you have to do more manual labor and whatnot, but if that's all you have, you can certainly do it using the same principles. It's just a little bit harder. But another first thing, that's the first thing. Then the second first thing is go to the tips and see what the tips look like. Can, can you zoom in on that, Lonnie? If you have an older pair that's been, you know around for a while and you don't want to go out and buy new one, which is a really good idea. We're always up for that but make sure the tips are, first of all, they need to be squishy. - [Bob] Yeah. Soft. - [Brad] Yeah. If they're old and especially if they've been on the sunlight, they can start to dry and crack and then they slip on the floor. - [Bob] They get real hard. - Yeah. - And that's usually how I test it Brad. I don't know if you do with that. I just go like this. - Yep. - And I go like this on an angle. And I dunno if you can go down, Lonnie and if it slides away, - Right - You don't want to use it. - Yeah. It'll go just like that. - Yeah, it'll just go like that. - So once you know that your tip is good and then, you know you got your pair and then you gotta look to make sure they come in usually three different. What did I say? A grow size is small ones for a child and a medium one. And then the tall one, like this pair would probably be a medium. I'd have to look, but this will adjust for me. But you take someone like Bob a tall drink of water, like him, six and a half footer. These will not adjust tall. - It actually has the numbers on here. - Sure. - What's real nice about this too. So this adjusts for someone from five two to all the way up to five ten. - Right. - So obviously I don't fit into that category - Yeah, not in that genre. - I'm in the giant category. - This is a man of men. - Yeah. - So then also, if you look up here there's little cushions that go up into your armpits. They're nice to have on there. Although if you use your crutch properly, you really don't need those. And we'll talk about that in a little bit. So you take your crutches and the first adjustment, there's two adjustments. There is the heighth of the armpit pad, the axillary pad - Or as normal people say it, height. - What did I say? - Heighth, height. He always says heighth - Bob that's anyways. And then you have to adjust the hand as well. But first you do the first - First the height. - Height "

So when you put it, I like to go a slight angle out and then this should not be pushing into your armpit. You should be able to at least get two fingers easily in here. Okay. But you don't want it way out there you want it just out about six inches from your foot Now to adjust that on these aluminum ones, - Quite simple. Push the button on both sides. - Yep. Now Bob mentioned there's numbers on here. Like this one says five ten, which I'm five ten. I keep shrinking. I used to be five ten and a half. But when I put it on five ten, it's too tall. - Yeah. - So it'll get you in the ball park. - It gets you close. - Yep. - But you gotta figure it out yourself. - Yeah. Okay. - So I have it all the way up and obviously it's not gonna work for me. - Right. So, well why don't you put that one to the five nine because I know that's good for me. - Gotcha. - This one's already pre adjusted, so Bob will do that. And there we go.

So when you put at that same angle and put your arm down the handle should ride right about at the wrist. Okay. And so you have that slight bend. - So you're gonna adjust that one. - Yep. Now they don't. I think they do make these that are quick adjust Bob and you don't have to fiddle around with. - Really? I thought they'd be worried about that cause it might loosen them? - Well you might be right. I don't Know. - Can I talk about this while you're doing that? - Yeah. You go ahead. - And so some people, you know because you're on crutches all day long and taking weight through the hands, we have a lot of patients who become their hands get real sore. So sometimes we just take lambs wool like this and cut it up or something soft. And we wrap it around like this and tape it in place. And that creates a nice cushion that when you're having to put weight through the hand all day long it helps make that a little bit more able to handle it. - Right. More comfortable. - Comfortable. There we go. That's the word I was looking for. - Yes. - All right. - All right. Okay. So I got them adjusted properly. Those are not pushing into my armpit. "

And if you get that irritated, you're gonna have some problems and it's gonna be uncomfortable to use a lot of the time. - It's gonna send pain and numbness and tingling down your your arm. - Right. - You might be squeezing a little bit. Right. - Right. - Just to hold them in place. I mean you squeeze the arms together a little bit. - Right. So they're not flapping around. - Right. - Okay. So you get them adjusted properly. Now typically when you have crutches, there's a no weight bearing status. One of your legs is not gonna be allowed to have any weight from a broken, you know, ankle, knee, whatever it may be. - Right. - So obviously that's my leg that's broken. So you're gonna lead with your crutches and swing through here. And you know, you just start out easy. And typically younger people get really good at this. - Right. - Really fast. You know, if I have someone in their seventies oftentimes we won't use these unless they're pretty mobile then we'll work on this and they do work pretty darn well and you can get some pretty good speed on them. Now - The thing about crutches, you can use them on stairs where it's difficult to use like a walker on stairs. - Oh, that's a really good point, Bob. - So that's why a lot of times they're a little more versatile. - Right? - Of course they fall over. Every time you sit down and place somewhere they're gonna fall. - That's true. That's true. "

I was using crutches as no weight bearing in four weeks later, the doctor says, well now you can put weight on it, but it's gonna hurt. You still might need some support. - So partial weight bearing. - Yeah. Partial weight bearing at that point. A lot of times you can get rid of the one crutch. Now, if this is the one that's partial weight bearing you're gonna use the crutch and the opposite hand. - Opposite side, yeah. - A lot of people think it's over here and you're gonna walk with it together, which you can do. But over here, you're much more stable. - It's a more natural walk. It's a more of a natural walk too. - So then the sore leg is gonna go forward with the crutch. So these two are a mirror from each other. I like to think of it. And then sore leg, crutch. They work together just like they're glued together. Oh I'm out of the picture, Bob. - Yeah. As an alternative you could. I mean, if you're not that fast I mean you could go crutch, sore leg. - Sure. - You know, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 - Right. - Until you get maybe a little more better with it. - Yeah, that's a good point. "

And this is similar to the bluish light in the mornings so again this is a biological trigger to wake up. Research shows that blue toned lights tend to trigger alertness and a red or yellow toned lights tend to trigger calmness. So if you must use your phone or tablet before bed check to see if it has a night shift setting. This will shift your screen colors toward the red and yellow range. Next, turn your screen brightness down as low as possible and use the night setting for reading and this makes it so your text appears as white letters on a black background. So many programs have this option in their settings. Also put your phone on do not disturb mode while you're sleeping and don't check your work emails right before bed or read anything that could be stressful like the news or even your Facebook feed.

Quit wasting time here. So, three simple ones to do. You know, this is great for plantar fasciitis. If you hit a section that's really tender, work around that section. - Mgm, yep. - Don't hit it right away. The first one I like, Brad, is to actually do circles. Now, you can do circles using one finger on top of another. - Yep. - Or you can actually take your knuckle and use that to make circles. But that really helps break things up. If you have some scar tissue in there, or if you have some, you know, micro tears that are healing, this can actually work things out. - Muscles that are tight, those little muscles that are in your foot that kind of hold things in. The other thing is, a lot of times, your fingers get tired, if you're using your fingers and you switch a new technique just so that you give your fingers a break. - That's a very good point, Brad, 'cause actually it's hard on your joints even, of the fingers, especially if you have arthritis or anything like that. It makes it more difficult. So, you can do some circles and you can go all the way through in to the heel, even. - Yep. - And all up to these pads up here, too. "

So, what we're doing is, we're taking our thumbs, we start in the middle and you pull it apart like this. And again, if it's too tender to do it, work around it. Hit the areas that you can tolerate. Generally, with plantar fasciitis, you can have pain right here. So, I might start right up here and work on it. Now, you can also use your palms. - I've got a thumb injury, so I'm forced to use my palms and it's working out well. - Using the fat pads of your thumbs, basically. - [Brad] Is that the hypothenar eminence? - [Bob] Yeah, I think that's the thenar eminence.

If you're a person that always has cold feet, this is definitely gonna help increase the circulation and hopefully warm them up. - I would say even organotherapy, I'd give it a try. - Sure. - Because, the more you give blood flow to an area, generally the better it is for the nerves.

Squeeze antibiotic cream onto a clean cotton ball and apply it to the wound. Cover the wound with a fresh bandage. Once the wound has formed a scab, wash it gently with mild soap and water once or twice a day. Don't rub or soak it. At this stage, it's a good idea  to keep a bandage on it during the day, but leave it open to the air when your child is resting. If your child's wound was treated with adhesive strips, trim off the edges of the strips as they separate from the skin over time.

You can go to our website and get our shoe list to find those shoes. And the second is to put some sort of orthotic inside your shoe that encourages this bone to go down so that when you walk forward you have full range of motion in that joint. Now, the best orthotics that do that are custom orthotics that conform extremely tight to the arch of the foot. Those can be full size orthotics like this or women's small dress orthotics like this that fit in dress shoes, flats and heels but that really needs to grab that arch very, very tight when the foot is in that position. That works the best. In addition, there are some over the counter devices you can use, they don't work quite as well but here's a good over the counter orthotic and see, the arch isn't quite as high. So, the foot is still going to flatten a little bit and not jamming that joint but it's still better than your shoe alone. Again, on our website, if you go to the website and do a search for numb toes or big toe numbness, you'll find some suggestion on some over the counter devices and some more information on the custom orthotics that can help this problem.

727,How to properly use a nebulizer?,00:10,04:38,10,278,291,U1aU0UbQUYQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1aU0UbQUYQ,would you like to know what options you have if you're unable to use your inhaler or if your asthma symptoms get worse sure one of the things that you may need to use is a nebulizer a lot of times the inhalers much more convenient the nebulizer will take a little bit longer but what it does is it delivers the medication over 10 to 15 minutes and if you're having really severe symptoms you may not be able to concentrate to do the proper procedure for the inhaler which we've talked about before this allows you to get that medication if you're in really really bad asthma attack with this there's two options you can use there's a mouthpiece or a mask which we do for little kids or if somebody is older and can't hold the mouthpiece but for most people the mouthpiece is gonna be the best option because you're gonna get the medicine down into your lungs and set it into your nose the mask if you do have to use a mask make sure that you do still breathe through your nose or in through your mouth to get the medicine down into your lungs and again it's beneficial because if you're really really tight when you take that inhaler the first dose of medication is only going to get to those larger Airways and then if you wait a couple minutes in between the next dose might not get deep enough so taking the inhaler over ten or the nebulizer over ten minutes we'll let you get more of the medicine really open you up really make you start to feel better so as far as how to use this there's a few pieces of equipment that you're gonna need one of the things you're going to need is a handheld nebulizer device they come in all different kinds of varieties different companies make them so they're all gonna have similar parts they're all gonna have a medicine cup the mouthpiece or the option for a mask the nebulizer tubing which is what you're going to hook up to the compressor so the compressor generally plugs into an electrical outlet but they do make ones that have an adapter that you can use in your car and some of them also have a battery so if you're you know into camping or going out and do stuff where you might not have the option of plugging it in the batteries are going to be there for you this is just a table top one so it just uses the regular outlet but it's important to remember that if you have one of the devices that has a battery make sure you check the battery because the last thing you want to worry about when you're out and about is that your battery has died and now you can't get your medicine so it's always make sure you double-check that to use the nebulizer it's very simple it's going to come in pieces and you just basically assemble it all together you attach the tubing to the compressor wherever the nozzle is and then the liquid medications will come in these little foil pouches sometimes it'll come with five of them in one pouch and then you can just pick those and they're typically a pre-measured medication that also has saline in it if your doctor orders you a different medicine it may come in a separate bottle in which case you'd have to put the bottle medicine in and then add saline to it these are just much more convenient so it makes it nice and easy free to use so once you have all of your equipment ready the next step will be to put your medication in and these just twist off nice and easy you squirt it in there attach your mouthpiece and then you're gonna turn the device on and when you turn it on you're gonna see a mist that it starts to come out of the end of the tubing you also speak a little so to take the treatment what you do is make a nice tight seal on the mouthpiece and just nice slow easy breathing and out every couple breaths take it a little bit deeper breath and hold it for about three to five seconds let's that medicine really deposit down into your lung so that can really help you breathe and open you up if you start to feel dizzy or lightheaded while you're taking this just slow your breathing down it's common for people while they're using this device to breathe a little too fast and when that happens you'll hyperventilate and it can make you dizzy but like I said real simple you just slow down your breathing and then continue to breathe for the 10 to 15 minutes that it takes to eat your treatment when it's getting towards the end of the medicine it'll actually start to make a sputtering sound and in that case you can just kind of tap the sides of it a little bit to get all that medicine down once the mist is stopped appearing that means that the medication is gone and your treatment is finished so you would just turn your compressor off and then if there's any residual liquid medication there you can just dump it out and then maintain the equipment by just rinsing it and then just letting it air dry so it's pretty simple really important to remember though with this that it has to be kept upright if you lay down or lean back and tilt this the medications not going to hit that part where it needs to actually create a mist so you always have to make sure that you keep it upright

They're sometimes surrounded by Spider Veins, a group of small blood vessels located near the surface of the skin. Veins have one-way valves that help keep blood flowing toward your heart. If these valves are weak or damaged, blood can backup and pool in your veins. This causes the veins to swell and leads to varicose veins. Varicose veins can appear anywhere, but they often appear on the legs and in the pelvic area. Most varicose veins develop near the surface of the skin. Deeper varicose veins cannot be seen, but they may cause the skin above to swell, become darker or hardened. "

So one thing you just need is a tennis ball and probably a towel, 'cause the towel helps take away the sharp edge to it. - It's a ball, how can it be a sharp edge, Bob? - Well not a sharp - Just kidding - Okay now you got me stumbling here. Turn around again, Brad. So we're gonna hit these areas right here. We're gonna hit right here, there, there, there, always on the side of the spine I think it's more comfortable. And you might even go down here. So there's six areas, one, two, three, four, five, six. Now Brad do you mind being the subject here? - Oh no, I mean you could go with just the ball. - You could with just the ball. - Probably pretty aggressive at first. - My guess is, yeah, it's be too much for you. For some people they might even have to put a pillow underneath there, if they're just starting off. So I'm gonna put it on the first spot there, Brad. So what I want to do Brad is put your arms up overhead like this. - Oh, I just felt a crack, yep. - Felt a crack, yep. - I could see where just the ball would be a little aggressive unless you really like that. - It's surprising isn't it? - Now you want me to go to the position two yet? - Well I would say for each position you want go for about 20 seconds. Take some deep breaths, and have your arms overhead, and even try to put your elbows on the ground. - Well you know my shoulders, Bob. - Right, but this would help you, Brad. - Oh yeah - I'm trying to help you. - I know I really should do this everyday I'm just having fun with my other exercises. - Okay, do you wanna go to the other side? - Sure - Well we'll go right to the other side. - So I'm just below the neck, kinda upper shoulder blade area if you want and that, you know this side is not as sensitive as the right. - Now you can see Brad is actually lifting his butt up which is fine 'cause he's trying to put a little more pressure on there, aren't you? - Yes - And with some people they won't have to do that. Some people that'll be way plenty or even too much to start right off with. - Actually just from here to here is one big step and then this is even more and then you start moving. - With some people they may even have to have a pillow underneath their head, - Sure - And they may have to have a pillow over the ball itself. It's gonna depend on how fixated you are or how tight that is. - I'm going to position three, Bob. - So Brad is moving down the spine - So I'm on the right side, down about 3-4 inches from that position one. - So he's gonna hit all six positions for at least 30 seconds, you can go longer if you want. So it's very quick, it doesn't take that long, but I'd like to see you doing it at least twice a day. You could do it more, you could do it every hour if you want. I think you'll find out over time that this works better than receiving manipulations or something because it's giving you prolonged stretches to these ligaments that are tight. And after awhile you start to see that you have more motion there. It'll feel better. - Yeah I can feel I'm already loosening up, Bob. You're in control, you're more relaxed when you're in control of the ball versus someone cracking on you. - Right someone pushing on you. And I've been doing this, I've been actually using a different device, but man that has made a difference in my running. 'Cause it brings my shoulders back and I'm in so much better posture when I'm running. - I can believe this is getting where the ribs connect up to the vertebrae as well, loosening those joints up. - That's a good point, Brad.

I know you look comfortable there. We're gonna move this over. I'm just gonna bring the chair into play here. So one that you can do throughout the day is actually just take a little ball like this, an air filled ball, this one's a little flatter. That's fine it doesn't have to be completely flat like this but it seems to work a little better with that. - Yeah that's a little more flat, but it's okay, but yeah if they're full and they're relatively firm and hard that's usually not quite so good. - So what you're gonna do is you're gonna put that in your mid back here and you're gonna do what we call hallelujah stretches. Hallelujuah! So what's nice about this one is it's one you can do throughout the day when you're in a chair. So it's just real simple to do and it's gonna stretch all that area out and you can move it up and down to different levels. I'm actually running out of chair here. - Yeah well Bob's pretty tall in the torso. - I'm pretty tall so yeah if you have a higher chair you can get that area up in there which is actually giving you some trouble. - Or you could have someone just hold it like that. (laughing) - And you can go lower and that's what's nice about it, again you can get all those different areas, bringing the arms back. You can even put the hands behind the neck like this and stretch back like this. It's a good reminder, this is the one that is kinda a maintenance one that you do throughout the day to prevent you from getting in that tight position. - And with all of these, even one laying down, make sure you relax, breathe. Take some deep breaths in, exhale, that really makes a significant difference. "

You just snap it on there, and if I could hold on.

You can put one finger on top of the other and it just really does the job. - And how long would you do that for, Bob? - I would do it two or three minutes, longer if you could do up to five even, you can do it. - You're probably gonna get fatigued fingers. - Your fingers are gonna get fatigued. I would try it every day. I would do it every day.

For this exercise, you'll need the foam roller. We're going to be rolling the quad muscle, or the muscles on the front portion of your thigh, and this is going to help to release that tension in your quads, and help to decrease the pain that you may be experiencing in the front portion of that knee. So you're going to go ahead and lay down onto the foam roller, and in this position you want to make sure your elbows are underneath your shoulders, you're keeping a nice, tight core, and making sure that back doesn't sag down. We're going to go through three different positions with our legs for this exercise. So the first would be just here with our toes pointed down. The next is going to be spreading our legs out and rotating them outwards so our toes are pointing out. The third is going to be bringing our legs inward, so rotating them in, and our toes will be pointing towards one another, making sure we're rotating the entire leg for those three positions. Now, during those three positions, this is what you're going to be doing. You're going to be rolling and scanning from above the knee, all the way to right below the hips, looking for any areas that might be a little tender or uncomfortable. Now when you find a location that's uncomfortable, you're going to stop there, and you can either hold or do small little movements up and down, trying to work that area out. Now, that tenderness may not go away completely, but once it lessens, go ahead and search the area again for another location that might be tender. Remember, keep a good posture in this position, and you're gonna go through those three positions where your toes are down, rotating legs outward, and rotating the legs inward. You'll complete this twice a day, and do it for two minutes. "

Now once you're in this position, you're not going to be able to sit up completely, so you can use your hand on the ground. The goal here is to sit up without having your hand on the ground, making sure you're pushing this hip down as far as you can, and keeping contact with the knees on the floor. You're going to hold here and feel that stretch throughout the hip region. So you're going to complete this two times a day, trying to work your way up to holding this position for two minutes.

Now in this position, you're going to squeeze your glutes and raise your hips up off the ground. This is going to help activate our glute muscles, and then we're going to push our feet down towards the ground. We're not actually going to do any movement, we're just going to apply pressure through those heels towards the floor. When you do that, it activates the hamstring muscles. So you're going to hold this position, and we're trying to hold it for 30 seconds. If you can't hold it for 30 seconds, rest and then go back into the exercise. We're gonna do this two times a day.

I shouldn't use the middle finger should I. - [Brad] You can use that would be the third digit. - Alright, well, fourth actually in our lingo. So I'm pushing with my thumb, I'm pushing the bone this way, and with my finger I'm pushing it this way. So I'm going opposite directions. I'm pushing 'em, and as I push 'em, I've been bending the finger. Now, if that hurts or hurts worse, then you do the opposite. You're gonna put your finger on top right here and below here, and now I'm gonna push this way, and I'm gonna go that way, and go, oh that feels better! So which finger are you having trouble with, Brad? - Well you can see the one that's got these scars. - Oh yeah! - It's still healing. - So do you have trouble bending that one or not? - It's getting much better, but I have-- - So you don't have pain when you're doing it? - Well, last week this would have been a problem. - [Bob] Did you try this though? - No I didn't. I worked similar to the claw, and I used my other hand just-- - To give it a little stretch there. - Yeah, because it really wasn't in the joint so much. It kinda smushed the bone and I think the tendon and the ligament-- - Yeah, you're in the soft tissue there. - Was involved so it wasn't so much the joint itself, it was the soft tissue between. I had to get them stretched out 'cause it was starting to tighten. - Gotcha. So anyway, you can have somebody help you with this. Somebody could actually push the bones for ya. But again, it works out. I've done this before on jammed fingers for me. I pushed one this way and one this way, it didn't work. I reversed it and try it and one of them feels good generally always for me. - If it doesn't, if it hurts both ways, just stop doing it. - You don't do it, yeah. "

872,How to do inferior capsular stretches of the shoulder joint exercises that help to get rid of shoulder pain?,09:58,12:51,598,771,1225,DmyeOteYnys,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmyeOteYnys,"and so then the next one is going to be for  the inferior capsule. sometimes this is a   tricep stretch is kind of the same thing. it's  getting that capsule, but it's also stretching   your triceps out as well. so we're just kind of  stretching and working the muscles all around the   shoulder to get everything nice and loosened up.  so again, this is one just depending on how tight   or uncomfortable you are. you're just going  to take the other hand and try and bring that   elbow up towards the ceiling. so now i'm feeling  that stretch kind of underneath there. i might   be feeling it in my triceps. again if you aren't  quite this flexible, maybe you're only to here,   that's okay. you just go to your comfort level,  and what you can tolerate. and when you're feeling   the stretch, if you're not feeling much of a  stretch maybe kind of reset yourself and try   again. or if you have some flexibility maybe come  stretch from behind and get that stretch in there.   and again you know this the terminology sometimes  there are different names different things,   but they're really kind of stretching the same  area. so again elbow up trying to almost bring   it up towards the ceiling. i like to go a little  bit more further back. some people will kind of   pull in towards their head, kind of at this angle,  but i like to kind of go back a little bit more.   but again try both angles. try the couple  different angles and see which one is best   for you, and what stretch you feel like you're  getting the most because you know what works for   me might not work for you. or you know what works  for someone might not work for someone else. so   it's always good to just try a couple different  things and just see what feels good and works   for you. and they both might feel good, so you  could alternate and do one one set of stretches.   so i'd be you know going back this time, and  then i'd be going at the angle the other time.   so again just getting those different angles and  different stretches usually will feel really good. and a lot of times when i try and do  my deep breathing when i'm stretching,   i'll stretch, i'll do the breathing a little  bit more through my chest. but if you can get   that diaphragmatic breathing in that will really  help get everything nice and relaxed as well.   it's just because i'm talking a lot, sometimes  it's hard to get that diaphragmatic breathing in,   but it really does help. so it's a  nice way to get everything to relax.   and then last one on this side so again maybe i'll  pull a little more at an angle going that way this   time to get that stretch. and i'm really just  letting my hand behind just kind of hang down.   if that's a little uncomfortable, you can  kind of place it on the upper back or the   lower neck area and just let it rest a  little bit while you get that stretch. and then so after you get those stretches in  we'll do another just quick exercise and these   are just going to be shoulder squeezes or scapular  squeezes. and these are some of my favorites. um   "

I like to use my elbows as a guidance. so you can see here, but I'm really using those muscles to get the squeeze. I'm not using my elbows to get the squeeze, I'm using my muscles to get that squeeze. so a little hold for three to five seconds, and then relax. again you're not bringing your shoulders up, try and keep them down with that squeeze. take a little break, relax it out a little bit, and then go back into the squeeze. so I'll do a little bit more squeeze and less talking with this one. so again squeeze in for that three to five seconds, and you can also do it without your hands. so if you just want to do that squeeze like this to make sure you're using those muscles you can. and again kind of holding it that three to five seconds. if you want to kind of tuck in your chin a little bit while you're doing it too, you can get a double stretch with that and then relax and then go back into that stretch. so we've got that little long break. so now we're gonna go into rotating the back a little bit. getting up what we would call it trunk rotation in sitting. so it gets the upper back the mid back a little bit and the low back. so if you have arm rest that works well too. if you don't all you're gonna do is just kind of grab and get a little twist. this shouldn't be painful, you should feel that nice little stretch through your spine there so you don't have to pull hard. again this one doesn't necessarily have to be a 30-second stretch. it can if you want it to be, to do each side. I like to hold the stretch because as you go sometimes you can get that little bit more stretch as you do it, but if you want to do like a 10 to 15 stretch and just alternate back and forth you can do that for this one as well because this one might be a little more uncomfortable. but again I like doing the full hold for this one just to get that nice stretch in there. and then you're just going to rotate back to the other side. so again if you've got a maybe a chair that is is tall so you can't grab on the edge, you can just do it with your body. you don't have to hold on to the side or to the armrest, but sometimes that's nice because that gives you that little extra pull. but again see I don't have to I can just actually use my leg if I want to and twist to that side.

I'm gonna place I'm just gonna sit on my hand and then bring the other one up and what you want to do is almost sit on your hand, and then reach over this way, and you should feel that stretch kind of through here. you might feel it all the way into your lat up into the shoulder. so you're getting kind of a double stretch here, but I'm lifting up and then arching over. so I'm not just pushing over it's kind of up and then I'm leaning into it getting that nice stretch. so this one again is a good one kind of for the QL, the lats, the shoulders, and everything. but again if you have a little bit of trouble with your shoulder, you don't have to do the whole arm all the way up. you can kind of bend over with it a little bit but you're gonna get a better stretch if you come up kind of squish into that hand and then really kind of arch over to get that nice stretch.

It'll give you a little bit better stretch, but try not to come forward. keep your back straight if you can so that will give you a little bit better stretch. and then you're just gonna go over into the other side. so the same thing, my left sides a little bit tighter because of my past surgery, but just coming up like this. again not necessarily like this try and keep your back straight so you can really feel that stretch in here and through here. but if you have those knee problems, you can kind of grab underneath if you want to as well. so this is just a nice kind of modification of this knee to chest stretch if you have a hard time getting on the floor. but you can do it lying down in your bed or on a couch too but if you're in a chair this is a nice way to do it. so the next one's going to be a hamstring stretch. this is kind of "

And it's really pretty simple. What you're trying to do is, you're trying to allow your body to drop, right, in PT we call this Trendelenburg's Sign where you just drop down to the side, right. Because you're letting go of the muscles over here that keep you upright. So, here in order to get it back, we have to contract our glute medius which is going to pull our pelvis back and over to the side over here. So, what we're doing is, we're doing a closed chain hip abduction. We're doing a hip abduction if we're looking at the right leg, and it's just lifting our leg out to the side like that. If we were to try to do that in a closed chain with our foot connected to the ground, this is what it would look like. I'm just going to let the leg go further away from my midline as I raise my midline to the right. So, just after doing this a little bit, I can really feel a burn in that left side glute medius. Maybe it's not enough for you, all you've got to do is attach a band. Get inside of it, in here. Put it around your hips. Do the same thing. Get up on your left leg. If you're trying to work the left hip, you get up on the left leg, and you face the hip that you're working inside towards the source of the band, the point of attachment. You let yourself drop. Just get really lazy. Let your hips drop. From here, you squeeze it straight over to the side. Let it drop. Squeeze your hips straight over to the side. This is not an ankle move. This is not a knee move. This is a hip move. All your focus should be right here. Let it drop. Squeeze your hip lateral, straight over to the side. Hold it for a second, and then come down. I could already again feel this burning, and obviously working a weak area. "

Okay. So let's say,   you've warmed up your warm pack in the  microwave. What you're going to need is a towel,   and the reason that you use your towel is to  actually wrap that around your neck. So I'm   going to spread the towel out, and put it  across the pillow. So you can use a pillow   at home. You might find that the pillow is too  high and that you actually don't need a pillow,   you can just use the warm pack. I’m actually  going to put that warm pack inside that,   so it's not directly against my neck and  causing me pain. If your neck’s really sore,   it can be really hard to move up and down.

That's the painful side. Those two techniques didn't work I'm gonna take this knee and bring it up to my shoulder and Then I'm gonna hold it and I'm gonna take my knee and push it that direction While I hold it, we're actually doing an isometric another muscle energy technique hold and push and if that feels like good pressure, feels good I've got an SI problem on my right side, that's feeling good right now and I do I do these too on myself on a regular basis I actually like to go around like this because you're a little more stable and then push like that But it doesn't matter whatever makes you feel better Now you can take this leg and put it down or here or up whichever works better gives you better results And again, you're gonna hold it three to five seconds.

Now you didn't have this one, but she had one that was made for a pregnant woman, right So it puts force around here and stabilizes those joints So yeah the way I determine whether or not it might help someone is I actually go up to the person, no Brad And I actually push on their pelvis and I have them walk and I know this is kind of a goofy thing to do, but you walk behind someone and if that gives them relief then there's a good shot that the belt's gonna help alright, so you get one of these SI belts and you put it on here And it has to be on the pelvis not too high on the waistline. The pelvis is right here Starts right here. So it's below the pelvis. Yeah, and you can tighten it up from both sides. You get it nice and snug Should feel good. And then you wear it throughout the day, and a lot of times, you know once you get it calmed down it stays calmed down Yeah, that's the whole idea, you know when things get inflamed It can be very difficult to get that inflammation to come down.

Grab a chair at home and we're gonna do some squats. - You want me doing Brad? - Yeah, go ahead. - So you can do it. You can do 'em behind it to hold onto it, but what's nice is if the chair's right behind you because then in case you do go too far and you lose your balance, you just go right into the chair. - Now some people have knee pains. So when you get down so far, if your knees hurt then those muscles will not energize as well. Or you know, that could be a potential for a fall. So you know. - What's nice about these too Brad, when you first start off, you can use your arms. - Sure. - Let's say you're a bit weak, you can go ahead just start using your arms and you can go back up and down like this. You know, usually we try to keep the knee so that it doesn't go past the foot. - Right. - So as you can see here, so, we try to go- and we don't like to go that, that puts a lot of pressure on the knee. - Right. - So, we try to do these where you kind of come somewhat straight up. - Right. - But eventually as you get better you might want to go with one arm. - Right. - And eventually you may want to go put your arms across your chest, even like this. - Sure, right. So not only are you working some bone getting some bone density but you're strengthening the hips and the legs yeah. Great for balance. - This is really a great exercise for balance. - Stay right there once Bob. - Okay. - Because the next step, stay standing. Instead of going off the chair, let's just do squats. Okay. The chairs behind you in case. - Oh sure. - Leave it there. So you get tired you can sit, but you're just gonna use a chair for balance. Or if this is the kitchen sink you can grab your fingers right around the sink. I'm gonna put some weight on there in case Bob gets a little carried away and loses his balance. - What's nice about this, it is a real functional thing too. I mean, that's how you want to pick things up is you wanna bend your knees like this. - Exactly and he's trying to keep it straight back too. - Do it, do it incorrectly once Bob. Yeah. - That's what you wanna avoid. - You wanna stay up tall, - Yeah. Keeping your head up, - Yeah. while you're doing the squats, and you can do these very shallow. If you start off with it, it's just, especially if you're getting knee pain a lot of times you do a shallow squat it won't hurt as much if you don't go as far into the knee even little shell squats like this are better than not doing them at all. - Right, exactly.

I'm just kidding. But it really makes a big difference when you get too far down, sometimes you can have a chair. - And again shallow ones are fine. I mean you can do shallow, you know? - Yeah, exactly. - My wife and I both do these and and she likes what she does is when she's warming up in the morning, she'll do off a set of 20 and she'll go do something else and then she'll do another set of 20. She just throws 'em in there. - Sure and as far as repetitions, I would start out with a set of 10 probably. - Yeah. - And as you get stronger, you can go up to 20. Usually that's as far as I recommend I suppose you could do more. - I do 30, sorry. Bob's a higher repetition person. - Yep. That's when it starts to burn, so- (both chuckle) "

This is what we wanna avoid in all cases, up tall working that posture. And then I like to alternate like this, Bob. Okay. So you get both- - Going back and forth. - Yep. - Yep. And as you get stronger, you can go a little wider and a little deeper, but believe me, do not make the mistake of starting out like this and trying to go down and touch your knee cuz chances are you're not gonna get up unless you're really strong.

I would go to your stairway in the house where you have some handrails, at least one if you have two handrails even better and then you can just start up and back down, you know if you wanna do one leg at a time and just do step up like that, you can do that.

Arm is when we raise both patient's arms in front of them, and the same side that they have facial drop, the arm lists and kind of floats away from the other arm. They're not able to hold the arm up like they can the first arm that's not affected. Then, we talk about S, S stands for Slurred speech. To get them to say something to you, because they're probably be very panicked at this point. I like to give them a humorous sentence to say back to me, or maybe something about themselves, or their date of birth, if they seem to be slurring their speech, then that falls into that category of S for stroke symptoms, and then lastly T. T stands for time. What time did the symptoms begin? The reason that this is important, and why we wanna write this down is to make sure we tell the responding medical services is because, the time of the essence.

If the medication is visible, confirm that the liquid is clear and not cloudy. If it is cloudy, do not use it. Remove the safety cap. Grip the EpiPen in your hand with the tip pointing downward. Never put your thumb, fingers or hand over the tip. Firmly push the tip into the person's outer thigh until the pen clicks. The needle will go through clothing. Keep the auto-injector firmly pushed against the thigh at a 90° angle. Hold it there for ten seconds. Pull the EpiPen straight out of the leg. Make sure not to pull out at an angle as this could cause a lot of pain and bleeding. If blood comes out, the drug also comes out. Rub the area for about 10 seconds just to help circulate the drug within the muscle of the leg. A second EpiPen may be administered if the symptoms continue or recur.

We're gonna take the single, one knee bring it up into a stretch. And you're gonna continue this as long as nothing is worsened or increased. - [Bob] Yeah, if it makes it worse, you're not doing this particular stretch. - Particularly anything down the leg. If it feels worse, below the knee in the foot definitely, right away, you'll stop. This more than likely will not do it, that's why I'm having you do it. And you can go up and then bring the knee across the chest slightly so we get the piriformis muscle stretched.

And we're just gonna do some crunches like this. Just to work the abdominal muscles, because when these muscles contract, the opposite muscles relax. - [Bob] Relax, right. - You don't even have to think about it. And we're only gonna do 10 of those, okay? And it puts very little to no stress on the back. - [Bob] I've seen people do that too, Brad, where they actually just do a little bit of marching with their legs. - Oh, sure. - [Bob] Yeah, and it's the same thing, it's kicking in the abdominal muscles. - Yep. - [Bob] And makes the back muscles relax, like I've seen it with back spasms, that this actually, you don't even have to lift up the head, you just move the legs up and down. - Bob we're gonna go over our seven minutes.

And then you need to have a pillow available. And we're gonna take this pillow, and you're gonna bring it underneath your stomach in the hip area, you can put it this way, or this way. - [Bob] Length-wise. - Yep. I'm gonna do it this way. And that's something that depends on the individual. And we're just gonna lay here like this. If that feels comfortable, you're gonna-- - [Bob] You're gonna lie there, Brad. - Oh! - [Bob] I'm learning my English. - I appreciate it, Bob. I really appreciate it, English has always been a problem for me. (Bob laughs) And so we're gonna lay, lie here like this. If this feels good and the leg is feeling good, and the pain's literally going away from the foot and the calf and the knee area, then we're going to go up to here. - [Bob] So what we're looking for, I'm gonna do it on this side, Brad, okay? Just a matter of convenience. - That's fine, yep. - So let's say this stripe represents his pain. - Yes. - What you wanna see is that pain actually starts to move up away from the calf and foot first. - Right. - So now he just feels it in this area here. - Right, so if that's the case, leave it there, Bob, cause it's feeling better! - [Bob] Okay. - And then I'm gonna start doing some mini press-ups like this, letting my waist and pelvis stay glued to the pillow. Do that 10 times, as long as things feel the same or get better. - Yeah, this stripe might even go up further now. - Yep, then it's time to get rid of the pillow. And then I'm gonna lay flat again, give it about 30 seconds and see how it goes. - [Bob] This is a nice progression, what he's doing here. - Yep, now we're on step number four, I believe. Or is it five? It doesn't matter how we do this, it's the same. - [Bob] You're on step number five right now. - Yep, so as long as this goes good, we can just - [Bob] Throw it on elbows. - Throw it on elbows, kinda hang out there. Now there's a little, if you can wiggle around a little bit, sometimes that can help relieve the pain. - [Bob] I had a patient that loved doing that, Brad. He would get up on his elbows and he would wiggle back and forth and it seemed like it started improving the pain down the leg. - Now, if all of a sudden if you notice you wiggle to the right and that clearly makes the leg feel better, and you wiggle to the other direction it feels worse, just go to the one direction, and that can be a big step in the right direction as well. So listen to your body. Any little thing that makes the pain go up the leg like this is better and then I'm gonna start doing mini press-ups. - [Bob] See, now the difference is, the pillow's gone so there's a little more stress on the back, 'cause he was doing mini press-ups before with the pillow in place. - And that would be a positive stress, stress that was good for you. - [Bob] That's a lot of Ps. Mini press up with a pillow will be positive. - (laughs) And I'm not gonna finish off the rest, Bob's gonna get on here to finish off, because I have spondylolisthesis, which means I cannot do full press-ups "

And it's best if you do have somebody else that can help you do this, you could try it on your own. We're gonna say that Brad's getting pain on the left side on the left leg, down the left leg. So what you're gonna do, keeping the leg straight. Toe pointed straight up, I'm just gonna bring the leg up like this. And for a lot of the patients I've had that have had a herniated disc. - Ow, ow! - This starts bringing it on right away. Yeah. Somewhere in this range, they'll start getting the pain right away.

(laughs) - A lot of times the pain will be up in the back. You know, you'll do that and they'll say, ""I feel pain in the buttock, or up in the low back.""

So you'll, they'll have you do this. Walk on your heels, they'll say. Doctor or therapist, I do this a lot with my patients or walk on your toes. Now, if you find that on one leg, you can do this and the other leg that doesn't, that would be a positive. You're unable to pull that toe up like that. That's a positive sign. - [Bob] Or if you can't stay on your toes. - [Brad] Yeah or it might go like this, and you're doing that. - [Bob] Or you might be having pain with that. - [Brad] Come back up here, Lonnie. - Yeah, Lonnie find us.

And if you start getting pain up in the back or pain all the way down the leg, it's kind of, that's somewhat positive. If you even do this, bring the head down and it gets worse, - Right. - That's even more of a sign that it might be somewhere along your spinal cord on the dura. - Right. - It's it's getting pushed and there's getting some pain.

The injured arm was away from the back rest. Okay. Now, remember, these fibers are going this way in order to get this, it's called a positional release treatment or strain counter strain. We need to get the fibers of the muscle where it's injured as short as possible in a very relaxed and pain-free position. So in order to do that, I'm going to take my arm and bring it over. And this shortens the muscle fibers. And then, because it's such a broad muscle, it's going to make a difference. Whether I have my elbow here, up here, whether I rotate my arm in this way or out this way. It's probably going to be more comfortable this way, but you'll know because you're going to feel it. - [Bob] So they're going to experiment basically. - Exactly. And you're the boss on this. There's no therapist that could tell you which position it is because you're going to listen to your body. - [Bob] You're looking for the position that is the least amount of pain. - Yep. Exactly. Matter of fact, I'm going to do this on my left side. Because that is the muscle that I'm particularly... I got a real minor problem with a set major. - [Bob] So that's why you can kind of move around to see where your feels the best. - So I'm going to do it for real here. I go this muscle. Actually, down here. - [Bob] That's where it feels better? - Yeap there. Yeah, when I moved my hand up there, it turned the pain off. It feels good. And now the critical part of this, and there's no cheating on this. You need to get a timer and you got a time it. When you find that comfortable position, time it for 90 seconds minimum, you can go up to 120 seconds, a couple minutes or even a little longer, but for sure, 90 seconds. And that takes a while. You'd be surprised how long 90 seconds takes. But if you're comfortable, just relax and breathe. I'm not going to do that here because it makes people bored. But when you get done with the 90 seconds or two minutes, then you're going to slowly open it up. You're not going to open it up and start stretching aggressively whatsoever, but you're going to open it up. And then there's not going to be any particular exercises or activity for the next half hour or so. It's a time, you can do some gentle massage in there to loosen it up. "

But you simply, and you can face the wall or go away from the wall or whatever, it doesn't matter. But just grab the bar with both hands and you just simply hang for 10 to 30 seconds. Now, initially this may hurt and that's okay, but use good judgment. If you're getting sharp pain from it, your shoulder may be too, too painful for it at that time. You may have to, you know, take some ibuprofen, use cold pack to get it to settle down. But for most shoulder problems, you'll be able to hang like this.

I mean, you could, you could, you know, just take partial to weight off. - Right, right. - So, you know, - You can rest. - If you're pull up bar is high, put a little stool so you can stand up to it and then do what I'm doing here. Bob, you bring up a really good point, partial hang first. And you know, up to 30 seconds is what he recommends, and then you do that three times and you can do that daily or more, like two or three times a day. Now he would recommend too, a lot of times you could wear gloves. - Because a lot of times your hands... - Right. - Start giving away. - It can be uncomfortable, you know, if you're not used to that.

And you put that right by your hip and you go vertical with the stick and you reach up as high as you can. And then you get a good hold of the stick and then you simply lean forward. And now what's happening as I lean forward, it's pulling my hand upwards, almost exactly like hanging. - It's giving traction... - Right. - To the shoulder basically. - Yep. So if you do not have a pull-up bar or you don't like that method, this works really well. And right there, I'm getting a lot of stretch and it's in the right direction. And I can just hang out there for that that 10 to 30 seconds and then relax, you know, and then do that two more times. Bob, you said you do yours. - Yeah. I've been doing on on the carpeted floor and we don't have carpeted floor here, so. But what I do is I actually, I actually put hand on top. - Sure. - Cause I'm tall enough. - Yep. - And I go like this. Or I'll put one up like this, so that it, it can grab onto it and not have to worry about gripping so hard. - Right. - But yeah, one, one works too, just this way. And the same thing I lean forward, I usually do reps. I, I, I know it, hanging, you know, is probably better but I do the... - Yep. - Pressure on, pressure off. - Yeah. - Pressure on pressure off. And the nice thing about this, - You know, you're making sound like it's hard - Yeah. - Grunting away there. - The nice thing about this, Brad is, I mean, I do this exercise and the next two we're gonna show you, it's a minute.

So this one, the stick is behind, thumb is pointed down there, you don't wanna do it this way. You could, but typically thumb's down. And then you get your hand up as far as you can and then you simply squat and that'll stretch that shoulder out. Now this is one where I've had people where it becomes real painful and they're not ready for it yet. - Right. You may have to go to a different stretch. - They bump up against the pain. - Right. Exactly. But then after things start to improve, you squat and you stretch out and you may do this, you know, the pressure on pressure off, up to 10 repetitions. As you do more, it should feel better and better. If as you do more repetitions, if it starts hurt more and more then it's not the stretch to do. - So another variation is just to go like this basically bring it back like this. - Yes. Yep. - So it's not as cumbersome. - Right. - I mean, you can just work on, on working it this way. Again Pressure on pressure off. - Yeah. - Grab the end of the even like, go, go like this. - Literally easier. - Like rowing the boat, isn't it? Or rowing a canoe. - Yeah. Kind of like that. Now notice Bob is, he's going behind him, he's not going out to the side this way. - Right, it's straight back. Now I wanna show the variation that I've been doing. - Yep. - This is, to me, this one's been golden. - And this one you did kind of invent. - Yes I did. So this is The Chicken Wings. So now normally what McKenzie would teach you is that you bring it up like this and I do. I bring it up into dural, but then I pull it out like this. You said that this is a kind of a wrestling move, right? - Can you see that against his blue shirt? - How about like this? Okay? - Actually turn, turn your other way, so your arm is - Like this? - Maybe I'll, I'll show this way. We want 'em there, now we're both, now they can see both sides. - So I go pressure on, pressure off. Pressure on, pressure off. And seriously, Brad, I think this is the one that did the most for me. - Okay. - I mean, after I do it if I'm having any pain, the pain, I test it right afterwards and the pain is gone. - So when you do that, does it hurt while you're doing it? Or does it feel like a, a stretch? - It, it did hurt a little bit to start off and I wouldn't go too far then. - Yep. - You know, I feel, now it feels like a stretch. - Yeah. - Now, now there's no pain anymore. - Just a stretch feeling. - Yeah. - And that's what we're looking for. - Now, if you have a loose shoulder, the one that dislocates "

Just kind of putting your feet out in front of you. The one that you're not gonna stretch, you can kind of pull it up close to you in just a comfortable position. If you've got a strap, that works great, if you don't, you can use a dog leash, or a towel, or even a belt if you have one. so take the strap and put it around the ball of your foot, not on your toes, not way down, but right there so it doesn't com flying off and hit you in the face. You want to relax your foot and then use the strap to pull it towards you. So give it a nice pull, nice stretch, not pain, just stretch, and hold that for about 30 seconds. Then relax it down and do three of those. So pulling towards you and that calf muscle comes and crosses the knee, so you really want to keep that nice and loose so it doesn't put extra pressure on that knee joint. The next one is gonna be a hamstring stretch. So you can use a strap "

The next one is gonna be a hamstring stretch. So you can use a strap or, you can just do a stretch towards your toes. With that you want to keep your back nice and straight. So you don't want to curl. Sometimes people want to curl down towards their toes. But then you're not really stretching those hamstrings. So keep your back nice and straight and just bend at your hip joint. And if you pull your toes up towards you, that kind of helps activate the calf and straighten out the leg so you're gonna get more of a hamstring stretch. So just kind of stretching forward. You don't have to touch your toes. You can try if you want to, but again the hamstrings come and cross the other way, so it's really important to get those nice and loose as well so you don't have that pressure pulling on that joint there. So again keeping the back nice and straight, lean forward, hold it for 30 seconds and then do 3 of those. The last stretch is gonna be for your quad "

The first one is gonna be a quad set. So that's strengthening the quad muscle on top here. Put your foot straight out in front of you, the other one you can kind of pull it up wherever it's comfortable. Sometimes you don't have that complete straightness in your knee, so it might be bent a little bit like this. If you want to use a rolled up towel as a target, you can. Some people like to have that target to push down in to. Or you can just have it flat on the ground. What you want to do is squeeze that quad muscle to push your knee down onto the floor. If you pull your toes up while you squeeze down, that'll help active all the muscles. So squeezing down. try and hold it for 5 - 10 seconds and then relax. So again if you want to use the towel, it just kind of helps give you something to push down in to. So holding again, 5 - 10 seconds and do about 10 of those. The next "

Using a roll is helpful cause you're gonna prop your knee up this time. If you don't have a roll, a foam roll, something like that, you can use a big beach towel. But you want it to be pretty firm because you want a nice bend in your knee here. You can do it sitting up, or you can do it lying down. I'm gonna do kind of a half here. But keep the knee on the roll and just bring your leg up until it's straight. So again, you're strengthening that quad muscle. Just coming up. I always like pulling the toes up as well cause then that kind of helps activate all the muscles in the leg. And then come down. Don't go fast. That's not really working the muscles, that's using your momentum. Go nice and controlled, nice and slow, especially coming back down. Controlling that muscle. If this becomes easy, you can get to 20 - 25 and it's no problem, you can add ankle weights as you go. But I would really just start off with 10 and see how it feels. So the next "

Now seated in a chair, you're gonna do a long arc quad. So you did the short arc quad down on the ground. And this one's gonna be a bigger motion. So seated with your knees and your hips at about a 90 degree angle, just kick straight out. And again, go slow and controlled. Don't just kick up and down cause that's not really working the muscle. Nice and controlled coming up, squeeze at the end for that quad muscle. And then slowly come down, controlling that muscle coming back down. So again, same kind of thing, just start off with 10, but if you get to 20 - 25, and that's easy to do, then you can add an ankle weight. So now I'm gonna stand up and show you some hamstring "

If you're tight, a lot of times it's gonna come forward, but really try and keep it straight down, just bending at your knee behind you like you're trying to kick your bottom. If you want to hold on to something to keep your balance, you can. So just going back this way. Again, when people are tight in the quad and the hamstrings, they come forward like this and then you're not quite working as much, but keep it straight down and come back. Again, nice and slow, not super fast. Really getting that end range back there and slowly coming back down. So again, starting off with 10. Working your way up and then if those are easy, you can add some ankle weights. And "

You can get it back with your hands. It's kind of hard to reach back there unless you've got excessively long forearms and fingers. If you have a hook cane like this or you grab a theracane or we got the Back knobber here.  The back knobber, yep. And we're going to get back to those muscles and you're just gonna work them. You'll find that you'll get on a trigger point and a lot of times I just like to hold pressure there for up to 30 seconds and typically it's gonna feel like it hurts so good and then it actually feels better and when they say it releases after about 30 seconds and when you're done it feels like oh boy, that helped. then you know you're doing the right thing. I like to do it a little bit differently. I like to get on the spot and I like to do movement with the neck while you're doing it, and I find out which one helps. So let's say I put it on the spot let's say you have a knot there. I might try chin tucks. I might try rotations. Yup. And I might do side bending. Right. I'm gonna see which one seems to take the pain away. Right. If there's one I'm gonna keep doing it. So usually, I try side bending toward the pain first. Okay.

And then you know you could start off like Brad likes to do, like down like this. Yep. My neck just cracked a little. There you go, and I tell you if this is one of those things like you can go back a little further and it feels better when you have the support here, then you're gonna continue to work it. If for some reason it hurts or gives you pain down your arm, you stop all these and then it's a different treatment. Again, why I like the strap for this one now, is now I can work my way up. Sure. And again or work my way down. And I work,and I like it, when I do it that way then I like to have it my thumbs right here and my eyes are following the thumb. Yep. I'm not going like this.

1101,How should you ventilate a patient with a bag valve mask?,01:27,04:20,87,260,437,oZBIFnFpoHQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZBIFnFpoHQ,"to it. Many times they do right out of the bag from the manufacturer. This reservoir allows us to fill it with 100% oxygen so that when we deliver the rescue breath to the patient, we're delivering a higher concentration of oxygen into the body of the patient so that it can compensate for any of their other things that are going on. Now if we hook up the oxygen tubing to the oxygen inlet and we do not see the reservoir bag inflating at an appropriate rate; a little trick of the trade, I like to put my thumb over the outlet here which seals this bag system off and only allows the reservoir to fill at that point. The 02 should be on high flow so that we fill that up, and we can continue to keep it inflated while we're delivering our rescue breaths to the patient. However, you may be in a system or in an environment that does not have high flow 02 regulators. In that case, I would suggest pulling off the reservoir and using it as a room air only bag valve device. So that's what this would look like here. Now when it comes to sealing the mask over the face of the patient, there's a couple of points I'd like to make. Look at the shape of this mask. You see that you have this apex that goes over the nose of the patient with a bell on the other end that's wider, and this should seal around the chin and face of the patient under their bottom lip. So it would look like this. We're gonna bring the apex part over the bridge of the nose while the bell portion fits over their mouth and seals around the bottom side of their chin. We're also going to use a specific method called the CE method of holding the mask and sealing the mask. Now we're going to put the C with the stem of the actual bag valve right there. This index and thumb finger is what helps me balance the pressures on the right side of the face of the patient. It's not the E that balances the other side. It's the palm of my hand that's gonna help get the pressure on the other side of the mask. The E portion of my fingers is literally just to grab the mandible or jawline of the patient's chin and jaw and actually draw their jaw up into the mask, drawing their face up into the mask. We can sometimes see mistakes where people think they're supposed to push the mask down over the face of the patient and that's how we get a good seal. When in reality, that's not true. We're actually making the seal with our fingers and our palm of our hand while we grab the jawline and pull it up into the mask. We're pulling up into the mask and then getting a good seal and delivering a good rescue breath with the "

Jody, I'm having a hard time getting a good seal here. Could you see if you could seal that mask, and I'll concentrate on the actual squeeze of the bag.

This exercise has four different dynamic movements in it that are really going to help strengthen the muscles that hold us upright and hopefully will improve posture. So, let's start off shoulders and head off the edge of that bed. I'm going to do a simple neck retraction to put our neck into better posture. Take two fingers, put them on the chin, and drive the whole head up towards the ceiling. You should really feel the muscles in the neck start to activate. You're going to hold this position throughout the exercise. So, with the first movement, I'm going to take my arms straighten em, overlap my hands just like this and put them on the small of the lower back. We want to wing the elbows up towards the ceiling as much as we can. You'll feel a very good activation of the muscles in the shoulder blades up back into the neck themselves so really focus on feeling that you want to hold this for about five seconds but if you want more of a challenge you can hold this for a little bit longer 1015 seconds if you'd like the next movement what I'm going to do is straight my arms at the elbow and put my arms roughly 45 degrees towards my side from there I'm going to lift my arms up my fist towards the ceiling when you do this you're going to feel the muscles in the back just get activated a little bit differently again five second holds from there I'm going to turn hands and then point my arms 90 degrees straight away from the body. Let's make a hitchhiker sign just like this and then lift our hands up towards the ceiling again. Again, you'll feel the muscles in the upper back just get hit a little bit differently. Five-second hold. From there, we're going to take our arms in front of us so they're pointed roughly 45 degrees and do the same thing. Lift the arms up towards the ceiling as much as we can to activate those muscles, five seconds. With the last part, I'm going to take my hands, place them on the back of the head. We're really going lift the head up as much as we can and then wean the elbows up and then we're going to lift our chest as much as we can off the edge of that bed you want to hold this one for five seconds really focusing on feeling it into the neck and upper back from there you can take a breather but we want to go in reverse at this point so I'm going to go like this like this taking my arms towards the side and then just start where we begin with but you want to do this nice and slowly for about 3 to five complete repetition and with each repetition, challenge yourself "

We just need a flat elevated surface like a chair. You can also use the edge of a desk or a bed. I'm also going to start off on my knees. So, make sure to put a pillow or towel underneath it for extra comfort. Let's go up to that flat surface. What I'm going to do is bend my elbows like this. Place the backside of arms, the tricep flat against the surface for a stable anchor point. My hands are going to go right on my upper back over my shoulders like this. Let's do a simple chin tuck also that is taking the chin down towards the chest as much as we can. The movement from here is very easy. Let's start off with what is known as a back opener. So, I'm just going to as a whole body movement pretty much from my upper back to my lower back. I'm moving my butt down towards my heels. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel it really open into upper back all the way down to the tailbone. It usually feels really good. Focus on trying to stretch into this as much as you can. Once we hit a very comfortable stretch, let's hold this one for about 20 to 30 seconds Do nice, slow, controlled breathing also. Let that tension out. When you need a breather, just relax by coming back up like this. On the next repetition, try to stretch into it just a little bit more and as a note, you get a little bit better results. If you focus on just letting the chest right here, sag forward down towards the floor. Really try to open up the upper back much as you can. How we're going to take this one to the next level is incorporating a little bit more thoracic rotation into it and strengthening the upper back. What I'm going to do is just lift one elbow up and then wing it up towards the ceiling. Pretty much from my lower back to my upper back is rotating or turning up towards the ceiling. You're going to feel a lot of muscles activate into the upper back. You want to hold this one for about five to 10 seconds. From there, you're just going to relax, take a breather, and just do this one on the other side. Do this for about 10 repetition on both sides. Again, challenging yourself with each repetition more into it and hopefully strengthen those muscles and improve posture and the last part, let's focus a little bit more into the lower back with a wonderful exercise known as a bird dog. So, what I'm going to do is put my fist together like this. I should say my hands together and create a V with my "

I should say my hands together and create a V with my arms. I'm going to use that to stabilize my upper body just like this. Let's do that chin tuck. The movement from here is very easy. My knees are bent roughly at 90 degrees I'm going to straighten one leg away from me like this. So, my knee is straight, my toes are pointed away from me. You should start to feel an initial stretch or I should say activation of the muscles in the back of the leg and also the glute. Once we feel that, what we want to do is take that straight leg and slowly raise it up until you feel a really good amount of activation into the core muscles, the lower back, glute buttocks, and legs. You should really feel this one into the core. Strengthening the core is one of the best things that you can do to improve pelvic and lower back posture. Hold this one for about five to 10 seconds. Relax, take a breather, and then just simply repeat it on the other side. You want to do this one nice and slowly for about 10 to 15 repetitions on both sides. Again, with each repetition, try to build more into it to hopefully strengthen the lower back and improve posture. An overlook cause of "

Take two fingers, place them on the chin, draw the chin and head backwards until you feel a very good activation of the muscles into the neck. From there, we're going to go to a corner of a wall. Bend your elbows like this at about 90 degrees. Put your feet together and then just stabilize off to the side of the corner right here with your arms and forward with your body weight. The more that you lean forward, the more that you're going to feel a very great stretch into the chest but you'll also feel the shoulder blades in the back start to pinch together. Focus on feeling that. Once you hit a very deep but comfortable stretch, let's hold this one for 20 to 30 seconds. From there, you're just going to relax, take a breather, and then repeat this one three to five times. With each repetition, stretch into it just a little bit more to get a little bit better stretch and hopefully loosen those chest muscles up. I also like to experiment with just doing a little bit different motions and so instead of going with a field goal position, I'm going to make a Y position with my arms and then just simply repeat this exercise. You'll notice that the muscles get hit just a little bit differently. For me, it's a little bit more on the top part of the chest. I'll also do a W with my arms and do the same thing. Go through those three movements. Whatever one that you feel just hits your tightness a little bit better, throw more reps in at that point and the second "

This is known as a shoulder blade lift off. We can do this one next to a door or a wall. I'm going to put my feet together, space them away from that door or the wall so my legs are straight but my body is angled towards that door or the wall and we can press into it with our feet and legs. We want to position our body to the point where our hips through the back of the head are flush against that door or the wall. Let's do a slight chin tuck also for better posture. From there, I'm bend my elbows at 90 degrees, put them off to my side, and press into the door until I feel an initial tension into my upper back. The movement from here is very easy. We're going to press into the door with our elbows, with our arm strength to lift our body forward. Our whole body is going to lift off. So, we're not trying to round our back forward to lift it off but use our arm strength to activate those muscles into the back to press forward. I feel a lot firing. You're going to feel it into the chest, the shoulders, upper, back. It's a wonderful exercise but you want to hold this one for about five seconds. From there, you're just going to relax, take a breather, and then repeat this 10 to 15 times. With each repetition, try to drive yourself forward even more.

Just rest your head down like this. In the first part, I want to identify weakness in the lower back to pretty much Optima the pelvic bridge. I'm going to bend my knees, keep my feet flat. Let's start with the heels pretty close to the back of the legs. Hands go right on the hips. The pelvic bridge is very easy. We're just going to lift our hips, our pelvis up towards the ceiling to achieve a nice straight line from the knees to the hips to the shoulders. If you do have weakness and you're not able to go up all the way, do the best you can. Over time, hopefully, you'll build strength and be able to get that nice straight line. You should feel an activation of the muscles into the back the hamstrings across the pelvis and hips, lower back, and also the stomach. You want to hold this one for about five to 10 seconds. From there, you're just going to relax. What we want to do from there is just move our feet a little bit further away from us and repeat this exercise. When you do this, you're going to notice that muscles get hit just a little bit differently. This time around, I feel it more into the back of the legs, the hamstrings. The further that I go away still, the more I'll start to feel it into the glute but go different foot placements. Let's say this one right here, I just struggle the most with. I have the most amount of weakness with it. That's where we want to stop and throw more repetitions in. You want to identify weaknesses, throw reps in, build strength because that can help improve lower back and pelvic posture. How we're going to add the twist into this exercise and take it to the next level to focus on the full back is we're going to incorporate a little bit more movements, dynamic movements to target the upper back. So, let's get back into our optimal bridge positioning and then what I'm going to do is straighten my arms like this straight at the elbow and then my palms are going to be facing down towards the better of the floor and I'm going to slowly raise my arms up towards the ceiling and then away from me just like this. So, my palms are up towards the ceiling in the final position. Really try to take your elbows in the backside of your hands right here down towards the floor. You should feel the chest starting to open up in a lot firing into the upper back. Hold this for about five to 10 seconds. From there, you're just going to take a breather and then you're just going to simply repeat this up to 10 to 15 times. With each repetition, always challenge yourself to stretch more into it to activate those muscles. If you want to take this one to even the next next level, let's get back into that bridge position but this time around, I'm going to do a floor angel. So, I'm going to take my arms, bend them at 90 degrees at the elbows like this kind of like a field goal position. We're going to wing our elbows down as much as we can. Again, feel a very good stretch into the chest and also pinch those shoulder blades over that towel. From there, I'm just going to slowly raise my arms overhead while keeping my elbows down until my hands can start to overlap and clap. Hold this for about a second and then just slowly come back down. From there, take a breather and then do this one for about 10 repetitions, but go through all of these motions and into em until you can get to the floor angel exercise and I really do hope that that gives you very quick posture "

1171,How to insert scleral lenses into the eye?,00:33,04:01,33,241,332,5UkYKwHIQyU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UkYKwHIQyU,along your scleral lens journey now inserting sclera lenses can be a bit tricky so I'm gonna walk you through how I feel it works the best for me but if at any point you have trouble with your scleral lenses contact your local eye care provider now first thing when dealing with contacts whether you putting them in or taking them out you're gonna be touching around your eye so make sure you wash your hands thoroughly next we want to identify which contact lens you're gonna be putting in I typically always start with my right eye because I am right-handed that way I don't mix up which lens I'm putting in which eye it's just easier to build a habit out of it that way you don't have to try to remember which is which you do have a mix up your lenses some brands do have little laser markings on them including little dots that will tell you which I belongs to which usually there's one dot for the right eye and sometimes you'll see two dots for the left eye but ultimately if you do mix them up and you're not sure contact your eye clinic for help now when you remove the lens you want to inspect it to make sure there's no defects no chips or any other problems now there's a few different ways to insert scleral lenses however I prefer to use a little plunger called a DMV no pro tip is if you get a DMV and it does have the bottom being rounded you can go ahead and use a scissors to snip that off because afterward you will have a DMV that has a little hole in the bottom and with this little hole you can see a light passing through it and it acts as a guide for you when you're putting in the lens they put the lens on the DMV like so and then you want to fill the bowl completely with non preserved saline solution otherwise if you're using a multi-purpose solution of some kind for other types of contact lenses that solution will have preservatives and those preservatives will get trapped on the eye and that can lead to a chemical burn you can often buy this special type of saline solution from your eye clinic otherwise you can also find them online I'll include some resources in the description below now you'll need to the bowl of the lenss completely all the way to the top that way you can kind of see a bubble of fluid forming on the top if you don't fill the bowl completely then you're likely gonna get a bubble when you apply two lens and then you're not gonna see well and the lens is gonna move and it won't be as comfortable now inserting the scleral lens you want to have your face completely parallel to the floor some people find using a mirror or something as a fixation target on the counter can help you with inserting the lens and getting it in the right spot but again you want to be facing down and parallel to the floor that way you don't spill the fluid out of the scleral lens when you're trying to put it in now most people find it easiest to hold the scleral lens in one hand while using the other hand to hold both eyelids open as you putting the lens onto the eye another pro tip is to keep both eyelids open during this whole process because that'll help keep the eyelids open as the eyelids are open wide push the lens onto the eye while staring straight down toward the floor the lens will gently suction onto the eye and into place naturally some of the saline solution will be displaced and spill out of the lens so expect it to be a little messy don't be afraid this whole process can take a few tries if you're just starting out if you do find it challenging to hold both eyelids open with just one hand look maybe your eyelids are just too strong then perhaps considering using what's called the s5 inserter this is a special type of lens inserter that will hold your scleral lens for you that suctions onto the counter and then you can just kind of hold both eyelids open with both of your hands and then you can slowly dip your eye into the scleral lens having it suction on for a lot of people when you initially get the lens on things aren't perfectly clear it takes a little time for that lens to settle so if it's not fully clear right away consider that to be pretty normal now next we're going to go over how to

Wash the injury with mild soap and water to keep out germs. While the injured skin heals, use petroleum jelly to keep the wound moist. This will prevent the skin from drying out and forming a scab, as scabs take longer to heal. It will also help prevent a scar from getting too large, deep or itchy. After cleaning the wound and applying petroleum jelly or a similar ointment, cover the skin with an adhesive bandage. For large scrapes, sores, burns, or persistent redness, it may be helpful to use hydrogel or silicone gel sheets. Change your bandage daily to keep the wound clean while it heals. If you have skin that is sensitive to adhesives, try a non-adhesive gauze pad with paper tape. "

That's going to stabilize your arm and make it easier to get the drop directly into the eye. Now make sure the tip of the dropper is pointing toward the eye and make sure not to touch the tip of the dropper to the eyeball itself or your lashes. Then gently squeeze the center of the bottle getting the drop to fall into the eye.

There you will find a little bump. And when you push on that little bump you will actually close the drainage canal of the eye. And by blocking that drainage canal you will keep the medication on the surface of the eye increasing it’s absorption and effectiveness. Also by blocking the drainage you will prevent further systemic absorption of that medication and help avoid some other side effects. Once you are finished, put the cap back on the dropper and place it someplace where you can find them easily again. Now that you know the proper technique lets go over some pro tips.

So, immediately what we had her do is we just had to take a roll towel, and Brad is gonna demonstrate here. And what she did is actually worked on trying to gently start doing some cervical or neck extensions. Brad, do you want to use a chair or what do you want to do? - Yeah, let's use a chair. - Okay, - I can go. - I'm gonna go ahead and handle the camera here. Again, we don't have a camera person right now. We're on our own. - We can do it by ourselves, we used to do it. - That's right, this is how we did it from the beginning, - the old days coming back, - Yeah. - So I'm gonna take the towel roll-wrapped up. We have some tape around here, the red stripes, and that's to keep it so don't fall apart. - Yeah, you don't necessarily need that but, - so what did you ever do first, Bob? - Well, first you know if she tried it without the towel, it just didn't work. It was too painful. - Yeah. So you're going? - Yeah, it was it was very stiff. So we just started having her take the towel and I had her put some counter pressure against her neck. - So she - pulled that way up - gently - and just started working on extensions. Now you can have your back up against the chair too, especially if you have a decent chair with a decent back. - Now, did you have a hole here or a little bit of, - little bit of push, you know, whatever felt comfortable that whatever it was letting her extend back. That's it. That's what we're doing. - So typically, you'll go back a little farther. It feels better with the support, it may take a few repetitions or even more, you know, throughout the day before it starts to really go back and the pain goes down with the range of motion as it increases, typically. - Yeah, it immediately helps some, and then over the course of the next day or two, it went away. But in addition to that, what you can also try is you can try some rotations. Brad, you want to go ahead and try those. - Sure. - You're gonna go back up to the bed, okay? - All right, so we're just gonna keep good posture and not slouched, bring the shoulders back here, and we're going to use this right Bob? - So, let's say Brad has trouble turning to the left, his left. - Oh! - it just doesn't want to go. Brad is gonna show you now you can pull down on the towel on the left, that gets pulled down, yep. And we should cross hands over. So, he puts the right hand on the left towel and the left hand on the right towel. So then he pulls it, you kind of pull on your mic a little bit there. Right. - Oh sorry, what am I gonna do Bob, Take the mic off? - Well, yeah, go the other way. - Okay, - so we'll just show the opposite way, now. Turn to the right now, So you can pull down on the right one, and there it goes to the left or right to the right. - Notice I keep the towel up here, So it goes across my jaw bone an iron arc. - Yeah, exactly, - really critical. - It just gives nice support for the neck when trying to do this, and it works really well. If it hurts to rotate that way, you might actually work on rotating the other way and then go back to the other one eventually. - Right. - It seems like that really helps. - Yep. - All right, i'm going to come back, Brad. - Oh, sure. Come on. - I'm gonna try to flip this around so I can see. "

Don't just go to that side, chin tuck, and go to that side. Yeah, I can see Brad showing it from behind there. Chin tuck, that side, if you're going to go the other direction, chin tuck then this direction. - So, just so you guys can tell I'm back behind the table maintaining my six feet distance. - That right, I can't reach him, he's back there.

You hang from a pull up bar. - He calls it brachiating. - And this is from Dr. John Kirsch who's an orthopedic surgeon and he's actually from 30 miles from my home town which I thought was kind of neat. - Yeah great minds apparently correlsense, same area. - Anyway, so we're gonna go through if you have impingement of the brachiating, the hanging actually helps take the chromial caricole ligament and stretches that and opens up the space so you don't have an impingement. So you just go to a pull up bar like this and we have an option if you don't have a pull up bar so just hold on for another minute or so, and I just start doing this one, again cause my shoulders bother me from swimming. I didn't have my pull up bar in my basement, there's a long story to that so I put it up last week. And this is all I do. And it's also, can be good for your back as well, puts some traction. - [Bob] And you don't even need to lift up your legs. - Nope. - [Bob] You're up on your toes. - I mean I can but I don't need to. - [Bob] It can be rough on your hands, so he would recommend a lot of the times wearing gloves. - Right, yes. I typically hang for 10 to 15 seconds, I think in the book he recommends up to 30 seconds. My hands get sore and I find that I do fine, but then I do it three repetitions, I relax, do some exercises and then I come back and I involve it with my whole routine. - Gotcha. - With my band aids so, that's a simple exercise.

You can use anything that's about 4, 5 feet long. - He missed the opportunity, I thought to Booyah. - Oh yeah! - [Both] Booyah! - Okay, all right, now we're happy. - Just a little thing we do for fun, you don't have to do that as part of the treatment. But you take the stick, do you want to do it standing? Cause you could do this standing or seated. - You talking about this way? - No no no, this is Statue of Liberty. - Oh I know, so I have to sit down or get on my knees you mean? - No no no, you do it here. Remember how we? - Oh I know, okay. I thought I was gonna do it sitting on this thing, okay. - Good thing we rehearsed this one. - Yeah that's right, we're really ready to go here. - So you could do this standing or sitting. - You can find a counter top. - Yup. And if you don't have a booyah stik, use a stick that you can grab good. - Like a broomstick or a - And it can't slip, so if it slips around, use something so it doesn't slip. And you reach up as high as you can and then you get a good grip on what your, on the stick and you simply lean forward and it stretches the arm just like it does when you're hanging on the pull up bar. I don't think it works as good as a pull up bar, but if you don't have one. - I think it works pretty well I do this every morning. - You do?! - When I do it Brad, I did it this morning, I stretch my calf muscles on the steps, I put these on the steps above me and I stretch like this while I'm stretching my calf muscles for my run. - So that would be like doing two things at the same time. - I've been doing that, I've been doing double stretches on things. - Oh good! - So, I stretch the one calf, I stretch the other calf, I stretch both calves and meanwhile, I've stretched the shoulder by the time I'm done. - There ya go, so look at that. We've got options there. So typically you're gonna hold up to 30 seconds and do that about three repetitions and you do this, all these you're gonna do daily. If it hurts your shoulder, if it creates pain, it may not be ready for it or you may have a different diagnosis and then stop doing it, don't carry on. - This is not something that we're doing that no pain no gain, you don't want to have, mean you could have some stretching, discomfort maybe a little bit but.

So the other thing, just a hint, impingement typically symptoms are it's pain free down but when you start to lift your arm up to around 90 degrees or up higher, then it hurts. Sometimes it'll ow ow hurt, and once you get up here, then it doesn't hurt anymore. - It can be a painful arch as we call it, or it could be painful at the end. - Right. If you want to do tests, we do have some really good videos on how to test for shoulder impingement. - Very common by the way, I mean I would say the vast majority of patients I see 80% probably have some form of this. - And that's sited in Dr. Kirsch's book as well. - Is it really? - Yeah - He concurs? - He concurs. - Okay, so I'm going to show you the chicken wing. - Oh yes! - So, with this one, what you're gonna do, you gonna, you need a pole or a stick, - I'll show it from this direction. - Okay, and the upper arm, that's the good arm. Okay, and the palm down or forward. - Thumb is pointing down towards the floor, or whichever way you want to think about it. - On the bottom arm, the palm is pointed out. Okay? And this is the shoulder we're treating. The one, the bottom one. Now first you might, first couple days you might just do internal rotation like this. Bringing it up and down. You know, you're bringing the arm up. But then eventually what you want to do is bring it up and actually stretch it out this way too. And you gotta watch out for your head, so you gotta go to the side of the head here. But I just do pressure on, pressure off, pressure on, pressure off. And again, I think this was a miracle Brad. I mean it was just such an irritating pain, it was getting to the point it was hurting all the time. - But when you did this, it didn't work? - It did not hurt. - It felt like just a stretch? - It just felt like a stretch. - Cause it's important that you get that kind of response. - I get the sense Brad that you don't believe in this exercise as much as I do but - [Both] Laughs. - We're actually, you know, it's not like Bob invented this, you got it from a combination from two famous therapists. From McKenzie and Mulligan. - Yeah sure. "

Did you want this yet? - Yup. We're going to do some rotator cuff strengthening of the posterior muscles, which help keep that _________ down so you avoid that impingement of the tendon. - [Bob] We should mention Brad, this is what we're giving away. We're giving away, these are the clips that go on the wall. This is the wall anchor, you get four of them when you buy, go from our website. We invented it. We were definitely looking for something to easily attach the exercise bands. - [Brad] So that's about as easy as you can get. - [Bob] But there's a whole bunch of variations you can do so it doesn't slide through and anyway. - [Brad] So this is how you're gonna do it. You put a towel here by your elbow and what that does is that keeps your elbow in the proper position so you get the proper mechanics. - [Bob] He's got a right angle here and he's not breaking that and he's not going up. - It's not this, and it's not this. The towel drops, it means you're elbow went too far away from your ribs. - [Bob] The flying elbow. - Yes. So you're gonna do 10 of these. "

Scapular retraction. - [Bob] So what he's doing here, you can see the shoulder blades are coming together, a great postural exercise. You're establishing the muscle base for the shoulder. Cause if this is winging on you, the shoulder is not going to be stable. And it's going to impinge a lot easier. So posture is really important, even with shoulders. Especially with shoulders. So, you really want to make sure that your base is established. - So, and you don't have to have the towel in there, once you get the mechanics right, you could do 10 of these, little rest a little bit, then I have my patients go right to 10 of these and I say put your hands down into like you're putting your hands in your pocket. And tell them to visual about where their scapula go. - Well yeah, what the idea is what you think about is that the shoulder blades are actually going down and in the opposite pocket. And obviously you can't do that but that's what you want to think. It just kind of gives you the visual of where you want those blades going. - That way the right muscles contract and you get the most efficient. I do like to say three sets of 10 of these with my patients, so 10 here, 10 here, I'm not gonna go through em, and then that would be one set, and then you do three sets. Are you tired Liz? - You literally, you can, you probably don't have to do that everyday. You could. - Right. - But if you got that in three, four days a week, you'd be doing well. "

So the next thing that we're gonna do is we're going to add some overpressure. Basically what overpressure is is you just use your hand to give you a little more pressure added to the stretch. So these stretches are actually going to be our traditional 30 second stretches, 3 times on each side. Now the key is for this one is you're gonna hold your hand underneath your leg. Now the key for this is it's gonna keep your shoulder flat and it's gonna pull down a little bit. so you're already getting a little bit of a stretch. What you're gonna do now is your just gonna bring your hand on the top of your head, not on the top of your head right here, but on the top towards the opposite way and your just gonna pull over to the side.

Alright, so then last one that I'm gonna show you is our levator scapulae stretch, and that's the muscle that pulls your shoulder blades up, that scapulae up. The key for that one is lot's of times people get hunched over a lot, they're typing on the computer, and those muscles get really tight. ANd when those muscles get tight, people tend to get tension headaches. So a really good way to stretch that out is your gonna take the arm same side that it's hurting, and your gonna put it up on your shoulder if you can. And then what you're gonna do is you're gonna take your other hand and put it kind of on the back of your head. And you're gonna pull it towards your opposite knee. So you're not pulling it straight down, your not pulling it to towards the side, but towards your opposite knee. Almost like a 45 degree angle. So your gonna hold it up as high as you can, and you're gonna pull your head down. A nice stretch, remember those stretches don't want to be painful, you don't want to feel any pain in your neck, but you wanna feel a nice stretch in there. 30 seconds, 3 times each.

Sitting down, this is really critical, you really have to address this, is the heighth of your chair or your feet. We want to set it up so the edge of the chair right here does not push in to your hamstrings or the back of your thigh. Because if I sit like this, and I'm going forward, that edge is pushing in, and that's literally restricting flow of that swelling. The swelling has to come back up through your lymph nodes, as well as your venous return. And if that is limiting that, - It's cutting it off. - It is, it's like a tourniquet. - It's cut off pressure. - It's like a half a tourniquet. So, we need to change your posture. You can either raise the seat, or lower it. You know, if you just get a cushion, this is a cushion that we use, it's about two inches. And it makes the seat more comfortable. And that might be a, - You can see that eliminated the cut off pressure. - Right, exactly. It might be, if you can't change that, you might want to put something under your feet to raise it up. You should be able to get your fingers underneath here, and then, you know, you have adequate space. - The other thing on this, it's kind of of on the fly here, Brad, 'cause it wasn't part of your board, but - I'll let it go, Bob. - You really want to have your knees not bent back like this, this even cuts off pressure, you know, a little bit, too. - That's an excellent point. - You're better off having your legs, it's better for your knees, too, by the way. - Sure. - As you get older, these are things you've gotta think about. - Exactly. - It's actually better to have your legs a little bit straighter than bent. - I always tell my patients, imagine a garden hose. When you kink it, it reduces the circulation. Same thing with your knees. - Good analogy. "

The next thing you can do, once, you know, you have good circulation under the calf, is simply ankle pumps. Up and down. Ten to 20 of them. Make sure you pull them up good and far, stretch those calves out. So, what we're doing is we're working the muscles here. That's the natural way to act as a pump to pump that fluid up. - Sure. - It's your own body's natural pump. That's trying to get that fluid back into the abdomen, where it can be processed, and you can pee it out. - Yeah, exactly. "

And this not only helps with the muscle contraction, the fluid, but if you do have pain in your joints, there's a very good chance the pain is from lack of motion in the joints. So, we not only want to increase circulation, but get the joints moving. About ten on each leg would be perfect. - So like his, it's pretty difficult, Brad, to go up further and do butt squeezes. 'cause that's what we have you do in bed. - Right. - If you were lying down in bed, - Well, Bob, the title says knee, calf, and ankle. We're not talking about the butt. - No, but we're trying to push the fluid. - I know, I'm just kidding. - We're trying to push the fluid all the way up, get it up this high, now you wanna use the butt to push it up harder. - Right, Bob is exactly right.

1286,How to self-massage the soft tissue of the arm with a spoon and oil for wrist pain relief?,00:40,04:26,40,266,773,a-vJGH6ex_8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-vJGH6ex_8,started in the first part we're going to focus on a big cause of wrist pain which is soft tissue tightness this technique is called muscle scraping or gua shot and it might become your new favorite thing because it can give quick results even in as little as 30 seconds we need two things the first being a large metal spoon we want one that's a little bit thicker and more round you'll get better results the second being a form of lubrication i'm going to be using coconut oil but you can use any massage lotions or over-the-counter pain creams such as icy hot or biofreeze start off by putting this pretty much from the fingertips all the way up to the elbow go all the way from the hands inwards outwards coat the whole area and when it comes to lubrication you want a little bit more because you'll have a little bit less friction and this will be more comfortable i'm just going to take my hand and i'm just going to place the arm on an elevated flat surface edge of a bed countertop desk it all works you just want it nice and relaxed let's take our spoon and start above the wrist when you do this you only want to do soft tissues things that you can grab like this you don't want to go over any bony spots because it can cause irritation causing discomfort so let's take the spoon and it doesn't matter if you use the rounded or the handle i'm just going to angle it at about 45 degrees and then i'm just going to work my way from the wrist all the way up to the elbow putting enough pressure in there to get a nice self massage but not causing discomfort but you want to do this nice and slowly for about 12 repetitions when you do this too you're going to find that one spot might feel gritty that's usually a spot of adhesion and you want to throw more repetitions in there to help break that up you'll also notice that it'll start to form red pockets on top that's blood flow coming into the area to help promote healing so once i've done that what i'll do from there is then attack it at a different angle and it doesn't matter what angle that you take it at you can experiment with it do what is the most effective but you can go down you can go at just circular motions if you want it all works from there what i want to do is go through the wrist motions to activate these muscles to get better results so i'm going to go into wrist flexion i'm going to go into extension and then i'm going to go into what is known as ulnar and radial deviation so that's pretty much just taking the wrist in and out do the same thing during these motions right here and if one spot feels achy or more tight while you do it focus on that and really work that out to hopefully improve your wrist motion and lead to less pain so once we've done this whole area let's turn the hand over like this and do a hitchhiker sign and then just repeat on the muscles in here make sure to go through all the wrist motions again and attack the spots that need it just a little bit more then we can turn the hand over just like this and do the same thing with the wrist motions with this also you want to make sure to go very lightly over this area because this is where the carpal tunnel forms to find the carpal tunnel just make a fist like this and move the wrist up and down you'll notice that there's a band that forms if you trace this that will go right into the carpal tunnel so go very lightly over this area but you also want to focus on this part of the palm right here so what i like to do is go over the meaty portions attack it at different angles and go with what feels the most effective imagine that you have an imaginary ball in your hand too do some squeezing motions with it and do the same thing actually i'm going to take a different part of the spoon right here and you're more than welcome to do that too just experiment with different parts of the spoon and go with what works best for you but you want to do the same thing and try to get this all nice and loosened up from there i just bend the elbow like this and make sure to go on this part of the arm too and go through the wrist motions and i hope all of this together allows this to just move a lot more freely and have a lot less wrist pain it's a great technique and it can give very quick results so another big cause

So I'm gonna get outta the way, Brad. - So point out anything I miss. - Okay. - If you got a rail then you're gonna take advantage of it, right? - Right. - Okay. You can do it two different ways. You can put the crutches together with your grip right there, grab here. And we're just gonna hop up, then follow with the crutch. Come on in. And we're gonna hop up here. - We're filming right now. - And there we go. But once you get to the top and you're gonna need to go back down, let's say that rail doesn't exist, and I'm gonna show the other option you can do with the crutch. If you don't wanna do it like this cuz it takes a big grip here, you can do the tea option. - the tea option. - So we go like this, grab here. And now this is really important right here. This is for safety. You must go down here and get a firm grip on that step. Not close to the edge, but right in the center grab here and you have a good stable base with your arms and down you go. It's really not hard. Now here, when the handrail stops and there's nothing to grab here, that's when you kind of have to go at an angle and that's where this becomes a problem. - Right? - Then you may have to go back to the standard way and you have to kind of think that out before, just by looking at. - So in most cases I would say this is gonna probably be the the method of choice. - Right, yeah. You know, if you can't grab, you know you're gonna have to learn, you'll learn that. - Yeah. - And then down when we go, okay. - The other alternative Brad would be to have someone take one of the crutches down for you or up with you. - Right? - If you're, if you're with somebody. - Right. Now if there are no rails and you just have stairs you still can do it. You have to be a little more balanced. - Yeah. You've gotta have you gotta be a good athlete here. - Right. Yep. It's a little harder cuz then we're gonna go like this and you know if you're strong and you got good balance - Yeah. - It's really not too hard. - It could be a dangerous maneuver if you're not really good at this. - Exactly. Again, going down really important, crutches go down first, center of the stairs. - Yep. You know, not the edge. So you're not gonna fall. - Right over here, up in front of it. Drops like that. - Exactly. - Really important. Take your time down like this. - Get yourself stable. - There you go. - And down. - And down like that. Now Bob, let's just show 'em from the profile.

Sometimes this causes the bulge and a lot of times this helps reduce the bulge. - [Brad] Sure. - But we've done whole videos on this. We're not gonna go too crazy on it today. Basically the idea is, you're gonna get down, you're gonna probably start, just prone like this for a little while. Then probably you're gonna try up on your elbows for a little while. In every case, you're looking for a reduction of symptoms down the leg. - Right, precisely Bob. - So if this makes your leg symptoms worse, you're gonna have to try some other things or try different variations of it. Again, we've done full videos on this, just type in Bob and Brad, herniated disc or sciatica. - Right. - Because we're gonna spend more time today on the traction part of things. - Right. - But eventually you're gonna start working on extensions here. - Sure. - Your hands underneath your shoulders. You're gonna do half press-ups like this and eventually you wanna do full press-ups and again the idea is reduce the symptoms in the legs. - Right, so if you got pain, if the white stick represents the pain. If it's coming up like this, it goes to the back. That's a good sign. If it gets worse and goes down the leg that means the bulge is too far out. And we need to probably go to the options we're gonna talk about. - All right. - Could you show one way not to do it, with the hips coming up? - Oh sure. - This is very common. - It is very common, your back is tight. So what happens is your pelvis starts coming up like this. - Do not do it that way. - You're not helping. - Right. - It's just not doing anything. You're in neutral basically. "

Listen now, this is, we're gonna talk about traction now. - [Bob] Right. - Traction was started, it's been around for literally thousands of years, if you look in the history of it. But really in the 1950s in modern medicine is when it started to be used a lot more in the '60s. Probably not as much anymore. And we were discussing, we don't really know exactly why. But you can just hang your body as a form of traction without getting a traction unit. And it's nice like this if you have a pull-up bar or a bar that you can hang on that's safe to hang on with your body weight. And now I'm gonna gently take the weight off of my feet but I get about 50% of my weight through my feet. And I'm relaxing my core muscles around my stomach and back. And I'm allowing the weight of my hips and legs to be traction through that lower back. And if you do this in your back and particularly if your leg feels better. You're gonna wanna do this more often. - [Bob] Yeah, and then you can do it quite often. - Right. - You can do it every hour if you have access to a bar. - Sure. - So, the idea is again, he's pulling the the lumbar vertebrae apart. It's helping suck that bulge in. - Right, exactly. Because a disc is not solid. It has gel inside and that's what bulges out and we didn't get that to reduce. We call it our go back in where it belongs. - Yeah, remember that one image where they used the jelly donut. I think we did it one time too. - Yeah. - Like the jelly inside the donut was the disc. - Right. It's been a few years since we've done that video. For me, I like to do this, just because it feels great on my back. - You put your feet out like that sometimes too? - Sometimes I do, I have to do this for a while and you know how your back responds to it, you'll figure things out. But if you're doing this in the throws of sciatic or that bulging disc, you're gonna take your time with it and then come back off and see how it responds after you've hung for 15, 20 seconds. And as long as it feels better than it did before, sometimes I'll have a tough patient, where we'll do this and then-- - It actually feels worse? - Or it comes right back. - Oh sure. It all depends on, I've got one right now that I'm working with and he is pretty tough. "

You need some ACE wrap, you can get at the - Hardware store. - At the hardware store. (laughs) - Drug store. Wow, these are not letting go. There we go. - We have 6 inch wrap here. - Yeah, this is too big. - Yeah, you should get the three or four inch wide. But, Bob will be able to show you the concept. Leave it on, don't worry about it, Bob. - Well, wow. Why is this grabbing, there you go. - He's just dealing with the two clips. - So, all right, what you want to do, is because we're trying to help push the swelling back up into the body, I am gonna to start one layer, basically right here. - [Brad] Around the forefoot. - Around the forefoot, yep. Because, again, the fluid has to go pushed up into the body, you process it, and then you can pee it out. You're normally gonna use a lot smaller wrap than this. This is, what is this Brad? - [Brad] I think that's six inch wide. - Probably half of this, you want a thinner wrap because it's going to be a lot easier to go around your ankle. - [Brad] 3 inch or 4 inch would probably be adequate. - So we got some clips that hold onto this, to hold it together once we put it on. Start with the wrap, so you've got roll here, you got the flat part here, I'm going to go on top of the foot. What we're trying to do is, we're trying to push the fluid up into the body. So, we're going to start on the most distal part, most farthest part away from the body, and I'm gonna wrap around like this, I'm gonna go around twice. - [Brad] Leave the toes exposed. - Yep, leave the toes exposed. And now, this is where I go up and around and do a figure-8. But this is where the magic happens a little bit. Because, people tend to sprain their ankle this way, so right now, I can give a little tug which pushes the foot out that way. So it's actually putting the foot in the right spot, and it's pushing the fluid out at the same time. So now, I can go ahead and wrap. And again, this wrap is too big for him so it's going to leave kinda errors, yeah. - But one thing you want to think about it is really critical is when you wrap it, it's a little bit tighter around the forefoot as you come up the leg-- - You go looser. - You don't pull so tight, otherwise you create a tourniquet issue, and then, it can actually make it worse. - Yeah, the worse thing you would do is have it loose here and tight here and it'll push the fluid back into the foot. - Right. - So you want it tight here, looser here, and then when this is in place, you can use the clips to help hold it in place. - Yeah, if you don't have clips, use some tape. That works too. And when Bob says, ""Tight down here"", don't pull on it real tight, it's just snug at the most. - Yeah, if you start to get tingling - If your toes are turning red you've got it way too tight. - Turning blue, one of the two, it's way too tight.

Now if you have this on, and when you put weight on it and it's uncomfortable and painful, you need to use something like a crutch, a cane, or a walker. - You want me to grab one for you, Brad? - Sure, we've got them all over here. It depends on your level of capability. Now in Silas's case, he would probably do well with a crutch. A cane might be helpful, but a lot of people in their 20's and 30's don't want to be seen. - Don't want to run around with a cane. - But, a crutch is pretty cool. So, make sure you're actually going to use it. You can use two of them, and then you swing through. If you just want one, if it does tolerate some and you wanna just unweighted partially. Use the crutch opposite the ankle sprain. So, right ankle, left arm. And then you're going to walk like this, so that you take the weight through the crutch, and injured foot at the same time. And you'll be amazed at how much that helps. Not like this. This is not going to work so well. People think it will, but it doesn't. You have to trust me, and just try that out. "

The next step is when it's not quite so swollen, but it's really nice. This type of brace really works well. There are air bladder on each side, and you just put it on like this. And they're all Velcro. It works quite well. - Yeah, it does a really good job of stabilizing it. - Yeah. - And they fit a lot of sizes because they have a lot of latitude there. - [Brad] Right. - [Bob] So, and some of these you can actually fill up the bladder with more air so it conforms to your ankle. - Right. You're not gonna wear this if it hurts to walk on it. You're still gonna be wrapped. But when you can start to put weight on it, and you still want some support, these are ideal. I think they're one of my favorite ones. Patients are typically real happy with them. - Yeah, this isn't something that I'd wear when going back to sports. - No, this is just there's still swelling, walking is just tolerated, but up and down stairs, not running or anything like that because that's too high a level. - It'll stop your ankle from turning that's for sure. - Right. - And causing more problems. - It really makes people feel comfortable, I think.

We wanna keep that ankle from becoming stiff, as well as motion is gonna help pump some fluid up as well. So I always tell my patients, pretend your big toe is a piece of chalk, and there's a chalkboard in front of you and you're going to make the letter A, always capitals. - Capital letters. - You're using your imagination on it. You don't tape a piece of chalk to your toe, literally. So, you make that A and cross it. And then make the B, and you make it as big as you can. If you've got a lot of sharp pain with this, it's too early. But, usually this is tolerated well, just don't move it as much. So the motion is going to help the stiffness, the swelling - Right. - And maybe you only get up to D or E the first day, because it's tight or it's starting to hurt, but then you can come back later on a few hours. - You give it a break, go right back to it, and see what it can tolerate. - Right. - It's good for, like you said, knock the fluid out of there, to help pump it out of there. - And then you can see if you're at the E, and the next day you can get up to the letter M, it's a pretty easy way to keep track of your progress.

1317,How to lock the T Scope post-op knee braces? ,01:43,02:12,103,132,418,_1NofulQlHs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1NofulQlHs,this device here is what locks the brace right now the brace is unlocked but if I slide that down now the brace is locked it can't move will often ask you to lock it at zero degrees before sleeping at night for the first several weeks after surgery you can see here how the number zero is lined up with the line on the brace that means it's locked at zero degrees if we're you're locking the brace you want to lock it on both hinges so we're going to lock this one as well so now it's locked now I'm going to fit the brace on Elizabeth's leg so we're

So with the pec stretch, you're gonna take your hands, clasp them behind your back, and you're gonna push down and out, and then push your chest forward. So just holding that stretch right there. and with stretches, they shouldn't be painful, so if you;re feeling some pain in your chest area, take a little bit of pressure off of it and don't push down quite as hard. You should feel that right through the front here in that pec area and just holding that stretch for 30 seconds. And then take a little 10 second break. So right up in here is where you should feel it. If you have some issues where the nerve is getting pressed on, you might feel a little bit of tingling while your doing the stretch, so again pushing down and out, and pushing your chest forward. Try and keep your head and neck relaxed kind of in a neutral position. So you're not pushing out like that, I tend to do that. Try and relax your neck and head area. But if you feel some of that tingling, that's probably just because you're stretching that muscle and putting a little pressure on the nerve. So hopefully each time you do that it will get better. But if it doesn't then you probably want to hold off on the stretch and get everything checked out. So we've got one more. If you want to shake it out a little bit you can. And then just bring your hands back. Again pushing down and out, and pushing that chest forward. and you should really feel it right where your arms connect to the body, maybe in that armpit area just a little bit, but again, stretching should hurt, it should be that kind of good hurt, hurts so good kind of feeling. Just a nice stretch there getting those muscles nice and loose in that area. "

The big thing, first you're gonna wanna do Brad, I think in my mind is determine which one do you have. - Right. - Is it a hamstring problem or is it a bursitis problem? - Sure. - So let's first go by your history. If you're an athletic person and, you know, you were doing some squats, or you were doing some hill workout, some speed workout, - Right. - I'm gonna bet my money more now it's on a hamstring injury. - Right. - Because the guy that just contacted us, he thought it was ischial bursitis but he goes, I was squatting. - Okay. - And I did this. I think, I'ma right away say I think it's a high hamstring tendinopathy, if you sit a lot and you don't do anything athletic, well then I'm gonna say it's more likely the bursitis. - Right. Right. - Especially, you know, you're an accountant or something like that. - And you still you're sitting on it. You don't, you don't get up and move very much. So the circulation is depleted, it's compromised. It's more at risk for this kind of injury. - Couple things you can do, Brad, a couple tests you can do. If it's a, if it's tends to be a hamstring, if you do something like this, put your foot up on a chair like this and lean forward, and that makes it worse. I'm leaning more towards a hamstring tendinopathy then. - Sure. - You can also lay down like this Brad, and you can even have somebody lift it up for you. And if that makes it worse, again, you're stretching the hamstring. Now, while that person's in that position too you can also push down. - Resistance, yep. - And if it hurts, when it, when he's providing the resistance, again, more likely to be hamstring. So. - These can be tricky to rule out one way or another. So that's why we're saying - It can be. - More likely, we're not gonna say for sure. - It is very difficult. It fools many people. - Right. - Many professionals, so, "

So the other thing you can do is you take, when you're sitting, and a lot of you are having pain with sitting, is to take a pillow and fold it like this. And you're gonna just put the pillow under more, under the meaty part of your thighs like this. - Right. - So now the sitz bones are kind of hanging out there. There's really not any stress on 'em. And I can sit like this, you know, a little bit of a balancing act. - Sure. - But it's taken the stress off of it. I've had one person that contacted me, Brad, that, he was all worried about being on a plane. And he goes, it worked beautifully. He just took a couple pillows from the plane and put 'em forward and he was able to sit. - It's just a matter of where you change the pressure point. "

So with cross fibre massage, what we're doing is, this is very difficult to do on this particular area by the way, but you're gonna take your fingers and you're gonna rub the bone, right below the bone here, and you're gonna go cross like this really deep. And you're trying to break up the scar tissue. And you're trying to get a little more blood flow to the area. - Right. Right. So again, this is why it's so difficult to determine whether it can be the bursitis or the tendinitis or tendinopathy because, it's right next, the tendon part is right connecting to the bone, I mean, they're, you know, a millimeter apart, - But that's a good point though, Brad, is that if you do the cross fibre and starts getting worse, it might be bursitis. - Right. Yeah. - I mean, cause cross fibre will feel good on a hamstring after a few, maybe 30 to 40 seconds it should start to calm down, but on anything else, on a bursitis, it's gonna hurt. The one way to do this cross fibre really, is really to use, like we often recommend using the pure wave massager. I'll put up a video on the link to this here. The reason is, nobody can do this for any length of time. It's just so fatiguing. - On your fingers. - If you're laying down, you're putting your foot up like this, and you're going like this. I mean, you can try it. - For sure. - But I mean, they're recommending like 15 minutes, Brad. - Right. Siri X, you know, says that. Usually two to three, four minutes and your fingers are tired and it could benefit from more of that cross fiction massage. - Yeah. And if you don't wanna put out money for a pure wave, you know, start this, just do a couple minutes. - Yeah. - And then do some of the strengthening and we'll, but the pure wave, you know, you can just relax and watch TV and you can get in there deep. And it really works out well. - It is a nice device that it reciprocates versus vibrating, you know, horizontally. - It has percussion, like this. So it really, it's a well built machine and we really are big fans of it, so. All right. The thing that we have found, Brad, "

The thing that we have found, Brad, the studies have shown that has really helped on this type of condition though, is eccentric strengthening. - Eccentric. So in other words, the muscle is getting longer with resistance, which sounds kind of complicated. - Well, let's do, I'll show one easy one to do, Brad, is just to do bridging. So when I bridge up like this, now the hamstring is lengthening, but it's also strengthening. - Sure. - So you can just start off doing some sets like this. I don't want you to increase the pain. It's okay if you bump up against the pain, you know, we just slightly feel it, but I don't want you doing these and going ow ow ow. It just, it flares it up. And I know this again from treating it with my wife, and she was able to do these. - Sure. - And you can also make 'em harder by putting the feet out further. - Oh yeah. - And you can also go one foot, you know, once you start, - Yeah, that's quite a bit more aggressive. - Yeah, that's a lot more aggressive, but these are the things you can start, without using what the next thing is. We're gonna use the ball. "

We're gonna use the ball. - Sure. - Okay. - Get the red ball, not the blue ball Bob. - These are, you know, if you have this, I would invest in a ball Brad. - Right. - Cause these are what are helping my wife by far. - Yeah. This is a superior way to work the hamstrings. - So what she does, is she rolls it in like this without putting any stress on the hamstring, and then she lifts up and rolls it out. - So as she's rolling out, that's the eccentric. - That's the eccentric. So she goes up, rolls it out, and she does a set of 10. - Then she puts her butt down and rolls it back in easily. - Yep. Exactly. This is just a beautiful way to get eccentric strengthening. And I become a big fan of that because, Brad, I was having a tendinitis up in here, and I did eccentric strengthening on there. It takes a while. I mean, I told her, it may take her a couple months. If you have a chronic condition, if it's acute, I don't think it take that long. - But she's been dealing with this hamstring issue for years. - Years. Yeah. So then you can also do the one leg at once. Brad, if that gets to be too easy. - Yeah. So he's crossing his leg. The foot on the bottom is the one that's doing do all the work. - And then you also go like this, don't you Brad. - Yeah. If you're doing that, you probably don't have a problem. - Yeah.

And you can first start just even doing gentle rocking back and forth like this, just to grab get little more flexion. You're trying to avoid pain. I don't want you to, you know, go into the where you really get sharp pain. You can have a little bump into the pain. You can get, you know, a little bit of pain then you're gonna actually try this movement here. You're gonna actually grab the lower bone here the tibia and the fibula. There's two bones down here and you're gonna turn them. You're gonna turn them towards the other leg. So if I'm on my right leg I'm gonna turn 'them towards my left leg. So that'd be counterclockwise, right, Brad. - Yeah. And, and you can help by turning your toe in as well. - Yep. - And that'll give a little direction - and then you're gonna bend while it's turning. And that's gonna, a lot of times that's gonna help get things back in place and it's gonna help aid the movement. - Right? So you turn, you do the turn, turn your toe in. As long as you can bend it further with less pain, you know, you're right on. You want to keep working it for some reason if it increases a pain and you can't go as far, that's a red flag. - Absolutely. Don't do it. - Then, then you need to go to the next step. So what's nice about this is you can, you know rip off a good set of six to 10 of these and you can do these every hour, if you want - as long as they give you that kind of response. A good response. - If yeah. And if I'm on this leg, I'm turning it clockwise now. Cause I'm turning it towards the other leg and I'm doing the same thing there. - Sure. "

I'll flip this around. - Yeah. - So if you're in your chair you've got a stool, any type of stool. This actually, this is nice. Cuz you could go two different levels depending on what you feel with. But let's say on this leg you can see that I can't get full extension. And then you look at the other one you can see it'll drop right down. So, and that, you know oftentimes is a case with a sore knee that comes on without, you know, trauma or falling. So at this point you want to get it up on the stool. You could do it on the floor works a little better on the stool, above the kneecap. You bring your hands here and you gently push and try to extend it more. Now you might wanna turn your toe out and see if it goes a little better that way or in yeah. - Cuz sometimes it does work Again, My wife, as an example, she did better when she turned it out. - Sure. Yep. - And, and it's really funny cuz a lot of times you may not even realize that that knee isn't straighten all the way but when you compare the two, you'll say, oh my gosh it doesn't straighten all the way. - So just to show it, here's my, my foot straight. You see, you'll do this pressure on pressure off five to 10 repetitions or you can make go this way or in whichever way you get better results, less pain more range of motion. Let's say by the first one it hurts a little bit. And then you buy the fourth or the fifth one. It's like, oh I'm getting farther. Feels better. That's the green green light Bob that's the green light comes up keep working it. - It could also be if it feels better after you've done it. - Right. - Maybe you know, while you're doing it it doesn't feel the best. But when you get done, it feels better. - Right. You're walking around and it's like oh that's better. Then you know these are all little tricks of our trade, so to speak. - Yeah. And he said pressure on pressure off. Cuz the reason you do that is that tells you how long to do it. Right. So you say pressure on pressure off. - There you go.

And this is one of the exercises I had or do I had her do the pressure on pressure off and her kneecap was a little tight. So when you do this it's critical that you completely relax your leg. Your quadriceps must be relaxed. Can, can you see that movement there, Liz? Yep. Yep. That's the patellar knee cap. - He's making that look easy. A lot of people, you know, again, they tighten up and and so it's really hard to move. - See if I tighten it, it doesn't move at all. So it's like, relax, relax all these muscles, relax. And I'll have, I'll take the kneecap move it up and down and right to left. And you can do some diagonals on there as well to make sure you cover all the bases. Again if this sometimes in one direction, it may be painful. You go pressure on pressure off after three or four repetitions. If that pain starts to get relieved, go away. Then you keep working it. If for some reason it just continues to irritate it. And the pain goes up after four or five repetitions then you'd avoid that particular direction and work the pain - We're not being believers of making your pain worse. - Right. - Let's put it that way.

So the first one that I think almost everybody should do and this is especially if you have chronic foot pain. So I'm gonna slip my shoe off here. What you wanna do, a lot of people are having trouble with the band on the bottom of their foot, basically the fascia. - Right, so the plantar fascia. - The plantar fascia, that's where plantar fasciitis comes from, but even if you don't have that a lot of times this band is tight. So what I want you to do is you're gonna go ahead and you're gonna grab the band goes all the way up into the toes. Would it be better with my sock off? - [Brad] Maybe for the video but not for me (laughs). - Yeah, not for you. But so you see the band there, you might even be able to catch a little bit of it there. So that band goes right up into the toes, so I want you to grab the toes and pull. So you're gonna pull the ankle this way and the toes this way and just give it a good stretch. Good like 30 second stretch or you can do pressure on, pressure off, pressure on, pressure off. Do this throughout the day and this is gonna help, especially with plantar fasciatus, but even just pain on the bottom of the foot. "

There's two primary muscles there, and we've got a couple devices that really work well. - The gastrocnemius of the sole by the way, the muscles. - Yep. So with this particular one, - Now we're gonna show you how to do it without a device too but-- - [Bob] Right. I really like this. I use this every morning. - [Brad] This one's got nice cam action. It gives you a lot of mechanical leverage. Plus, it's got a toe wedge which extends the toe. Does the same thing Bob's does. - That's why I like it. It's a great stretch before running or walking. And then it's just easy to rock on it. - You can do the same. Pressure on, pressure off. 10 times or hold it for 30 seconds. If you want you can just get an incline board like this. This one is in my name. We have a video on how to make one if you've got someone handy around the house they're relatively simple. Just solids of plywood. Or you can buy these too. And this works really well. I like this. I use this one at home. Just because I have one. - By the way, this is a called a ProStretch Plus. A ProStretch Plus. The plus is the extra toe thing. You wanna show Brad how you can just do it? You can do it without anything. - Sure. Can you zoom over this way? - [Bob] He's gonna show it against the wall. - Yeah and this works. Not as well as a device but pretty good. It works fine. It works better when your shoe on. Make sure your toes not pointed this way. It should be straight towards the wall. Heel down and lean in to the wall. - So again, it's important to stretch this whole complex here. - Sure. - They call it the posterior chain when we talk about the hip and stuff. It's the same down here. This is all connected here. And so the more stress you can take off the less stress you're putting on the foot. "

So the first one is just real simple. I want you to use them to strengthen both the gastrocnemius and the soleus both the gastrocnemius and the soleus, but you also gonna strengthen the bottom of the foot. The little bit of the intrinsic. - Sure. - So basically I'm just going to have you raise up on your toes and raise up on your heels. Now you can do it next to a countertop or a chair and you can do these throughout the day. It's really great to do these just as a strengthening one. So you don't take a lot of time out of your day, even when talking to your spouse or your loved ones. - It happens to be a great one for if your balance is off or you're elderly.

Next one Brad's gonna show the zig-zags. - Oh yeah! - Again, the muscles that are more lateral or more medial. So I inside, outside. It's gonna catch all of those. - So when your ankle goes this way that's normally the way you sprain it. But this actually strengthens the muscle. So this you need to have your shoes on. Something a little grippy on a floor like this, to offer some resistance. And we go back and forth like this. And you go about five or 10 feet one direction. And then you go the other way. And again we're not just strengthening the ankles and the feet, actually you're working some of the hip muscles as well. If that's too easy, you simply go on one foot. And if you have a cane or something or a stick to hold on that works good for balance. You may not need it. - You like look quite the dancer there Brad. - Oh yeah! Well Fred Astaire was. - [Bob] He taught a lot. - Exactly right. (laughs) - Yeah this is one of his techniques he doesn't show me. - That's right, he didn't show a lot. "

And you can just work it. I'm going to work it. And you work it wherever it feels good. If you hit a spot that's really tender you can work at it. But only continue after it starts to feel better over the next 20 or 30 seconds. So you don't want to irritate it. Sometimes a sore spot will work it's way out after that long, and then you know you're good. - [Bob] And sometimes we've kind of alluded to the fact we should work around the sore spot. - There you go, yeah. Now this is literally was at the grocery store, right? Before your checkout? - Oh sure. - If you need this thing. It's actually got nice spikes. Little spiky things. But it's soft. And it actually lights up. Oh yeah! - [Bob] Which is a nice thing. - But that really changes compared to the lacrosse ball or the tennis ball. The little knobbies on there helps it. - [Bob] So it's not too much. - This cost me two dollars! - [Bob] No but I mean it's not too much as far as the spikes? - [Brad] No it's not too aggressive. This one's not. This is soft and it's a little squishy. Just adds a little bit.

1416,How to prevent a hand vein from rolling?,05:56,07:24,356,444,482,NkKNLBMq-C8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkKNLBMq-C8,a problem with the hand veins is when you start an IV these veins like to roll so let me give you some tips on how to prevent a rolling vein first of all whenever you're assessing your veins you want to make sure it is in a roller how you can tell if a vein is a roller you'll take your finger and just sort of mess with it and whenever you mess with it do you see how these see how that vein right there likes to roll side to side okay what's going to happen if we didn't use this trick I'm going to show you if I poked him with a needle I poke the skin whenever I poked it it would go to the side like that okay and then your vet your needle would go beside of the vein and set it in it and then it would roll all you'd miss and you'd have to try all over so what you would do is you have the patient hold their hand nice tight fist and see it keeps really really tight so whenever I stick him with this knead with a needle it wouldn't roll it's less likely to roll so that's always a tip now if you were starting it up in the forearm and it was a rolling thing you could just keep it taut like that just do your hand out like that and keep it taut and then poke it with a needle and it should keep it from rolling sometimes things are gonna roll and it's just gonna happen but those are some little tips and tricks on how to prevent that and then whenever you're done of course starting your IV you'll pop the tarnish off flow fast and then

1420,How to lie on a foam roller to fix kyphosis or hunchback posture?,01:40,05:00,100,300,491,DQ4Quue_Gns,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ4Quue_Gns,"Here we go. So the first thing we're going to want to do is try to help open up the front side, right? That's not really an easy place to work on, right? You can't exactly foam roll that very comfortably without possibly smashing some things that you don't want to smash. So if you are a manual therapist, if you're a massage therapist, you can work all along the rectus abdominis, or the six pack, that everybody loves so much. You may want to actually help work, basically help relax the rectus abdominis on your clients. So a lot of times... I've actually had two in the last year, two ladies, who had gotten their abs so tight and so strong, the rectus abs and also the obliques, but a lot through the rectus abdominis, they had gotten so tight that they gave themselves severe back pain. And one of them gave herself really bad pain at the base of her neck, just because those had crunched her in so much. So if you're doing massage, you can try to massage that out, to help loosen that up. Now, if you can't do that, then one thing you can do is just grab a foam roller and go at it from the other direction. So what you're going to do is you're going to just keep your lower back pretty much flat. You can go into a slight lordosis, but we don't want it to get into a crazy, crazy curve as we're doing this. We want to keep the lower back pretty neutral. The whole time we're doing this, we're going to support our heads, support the head in our hands, and you're just going to let yourself curve over the foam roller. Now I said you want to keep the lower back in neutral while you're doing this. That's to make sure you're not just curving over the foam roller by letting your lower back go into an arch. You keep it out of the arch and you let your upper back, at the point that it's making contact with the foam roller, you're letting that part arch. Okay, so it's not your lower back arching. It's actually your mid and upper back arching. Now this is attacking the problem that Zach's talking about in two ways. It's helping the muscles relax, right? Those cords on either side of the spine, it's helping those relax. And it's also giving you a fulcrum from which you can make the spine go into extension. So where it's always flexed like this, now you can just use gravity and body weight to open it back up. So that's item number one. You just kind of hang out, find the most tough spots, the places where you're most curved, and you just let yourself gently relax in those spots. You're probably gonna need to spend... Generally what I recommend is spending about a minute on at least three or four spots. If you want to go like spot one, spot two, spot three, and then back to two and then to one, then two, then three, then just do that. If you have time do that, otherwise you just go one, two, three, and then move on to something else. So when I'm working with clients who have a lot of kyphosis, I'll often do that, just throw that in, in the beginning, just to help open things up before we start doing any more exercise. "
1421,How to sit against a wall to fix kyphosis or hunchback posture?,05:01,07:45,301,465,491,DQ4Quue_Gns,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ4Quue_Gns,"Okay, then the next thing you're going to do is right here on the wall. So once you've gotten the back all loosened up that way, you've kind of given it the ability to get where you want it to go, back yourself up into a wall. You've gotta have your knees bent if you have really, really tight hamstrings. And I think Zach, part of your message actually said, you can't even get up against the wall like this. So if you can't, you just bend your knees, you get your butt against the wall, you get your lower back flat against the wall. You get your upper back flat against the wall and you get the back of your head flat against the wall. So what you're doing is you're basically saying, so this is your curvature, right? You have this big kyphosis up here. We're saying this is the upper back. This is the lower back and the lordosis. In this big curve, if I tell you to stand up straight, what most people will do is go (grunts), right? And they give themselves... Effectively they've just lifted their chests up a little bit by pushing their spine back, okay. So what we're doing right now is saying, okay, we're not going to even allow any movement of the spine. We're just going to push everything into a flat position and then now straighten up, right? So now when you go to straighten up, the upper back is not allowed to cheat. The lower back also is not allowed to cheat. Everything stays in position as the upper and mid back have to straighten up. Now, the key here is when we're trying to get the head against the wall, you want to keep the chin tucked. We don't want to be lifting up like that, okay? If I'm coming back like this, a lot of people with a lot of kyphosis will almost, they'll basically tip their heads back and be touching the back of their, the top of their head against the wall because the kyphosis is so strong. You want to make sure you're coming at it with the back of your head, right? So you're just keeping the chin tucked and then pulling back. You wanna keep your shoulders back a little bit. You don't have to exaggerate it. That will generally pull you off of the wall, so we just have a little bit of a shoulder, a little bit of shoulder blade retraction, keep the chin tucked and keep your head back there. This position you'd hold for least two minutes. I like doing three minutes with most people. If it's pretty rough and they got a lot of kyphosis, then I'll do it for like five minutes. Definitely we'll assign that for homework to make sure they're constantly getting that positive stimulus to help with the kyphosis. "

Now, special note: if they're sweaty, dry them off. If there's any kind of gel, dry it off. If there's jewelry, it doesn't matter if they have piercings, but if they have a necklace and it's in between these two pads, we're gonna move that jewelry just to the side so it's not in the way of the electrical pathway. These are actually sticking quite well so now I'm gonna go to the last step which is plugging in the connector. Make sure not to touch the patient, don't bump them. OK, we allow the AED to charge.

So  now you're just going to have your thumb up,   and you're going into that radial deviation.  So kind of everything that we did with the   others for modifications if you need it are the  same, but really kind of try and get in that   smooth motion and keep your wrist here in a  neutral position. So it's not doing it out here.   It's not doing out here cuz that's  going to really kind of pinch that   area. Try and keep that wrist in a neutral  position really for this one, and then going up and down. And then same thing over here and if you  want to prop it up on your leg or on a table,   this would be the way just make sure that your  wrist is off of whatever is propped up on so   it can get that full motion. They're going all  the way down, and then coming all the way up. short   break, you don't have to make the little loop handle  like I have. Sometimes it's hard to get these   knots to stay, you can just hold it like this  if you want to. But if you happen to have maybe   some pain tenderness or some arthritis, especially  in your fingers, I find having the loop is a   little bit better, because then you don't have to  squeeze so hard to hold on to the band. So that's   just a little tip there. But I would definitely  try and make the loop before you start. Because   sometimes it does is you want to make sure  again, that that that knot is tight. So then   while you're doing the exercises, it doesn't  come loose, and then kind of snap back at you. Because that's not comfortable at all. And then again, same thing with these, if  maybe that full motion is just a little bit   uncomfortable, you can modify by just starting in  that neutral position and coming up. Or if that   end range is a little bit uncomfortable, you can  start a little further down, and then just come   into that neutral position. And then hopefully,  as you continue to do it and get stronger,   you'll be able to go through that full motion with  less pain or no pain at all. Again, little bit of   pain is okay through the exercises, as long  as the pain stops once you stop the exercise.   So as you can imagine, the next one is going to be  owner deviation.

So same kind of motion. But now we're just   going to hold it up with the band like this, and  then turn out until that owner deviation there. So   same thing, you want to keep that wrist in that  neutral position, you don't want it to be up,   you don't want it to be down, you want it to be  kind of straightforward. And then you're just   turning that hand out, I'm going to kind of  go downwards. So you can see a little bit that   motion going out that way. Again, if you want to  hold on to the loop, you can do still do that as   well just give yourself some tension on that  other side. And you're going out that way. So   again, just coming back up instead of trying to  anchor it and you know, turn your hand and go   the other way, because then that would probably be  pretty uncomfortable. So I'm just going to hold.   So you can just hold this way, if you wanted to do  both at the same time. You You could, but I like   doing one at a time for some of these, because  maybe one wrist is a little bit weaker than the   other. And so if you're doing them both at the  same time, sometimes it's hard to push one harder   than the other. So I like kind of separating  them out. But once you get the technique down and   everything feels good, if you're pressed for time,  you can definitely do them both at the same time.   So I'll go back to holding the loop this time. So  again, you can just kind of see how that works.   Holding here, and then turning out if  maybe squeezing onto that band is a   little uncomfortable on your fingers. Because  you could even, you know have your fingers out   and do that deviation. Same thing with all the  other ones. So if you're, you know uncomfortable   curling your fingers, you can have them out,  and I'm still getting that ulnar deviation,   I just feel like if I make a fist, sometimes I can  get a little bit better motion in there with that.   And then I'll use the band  over here for this one as well. exercise for going out and again, I'll turn this way  a little bit so you can see it this way.   So that pinky slide is coming over to the  side, but again, in that neutral position,   not down here, not up here. Trying to keep  that hand what we call neutral position is that   there's not really a been there at the wrist. So  there's that straight, flat area up on top there. "
1472,How to do stretching of wrist flexor muscles?,14:39,17:10,879,1030,1596,c0-urMVG8xw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0-urMVG8xw,"stretch those flexors underneath. So a lot of  times people get confused that with that because   you're going into extension, but you're stretching  those flexor muscles. So arm straight out   and just pull your fingers in an upwards position  and you should feel those wrist flexors underneath   getting a nice stretch. Now if this is too  much You're like, whoo, I'm feeling this a lot,   curl your fingers in. And that'll be just a  little bit less of a stretch. And I'm turning   a little bit so you can see it. Ideally, you  want to keep it straight in front of you,   so you don't twist and get your back irritated.  You can also do this against a wall as well.   But is that all 32nd hold for this one. So  maybe I'll turn a little bit so you can kind   of see the angle on this one. So again, fist,  if it's too much, getting that. And if that's   not quite enough, open up your hand and get that  stretch. And that's because those tendons come   all the way down into the fingers. So it  makes a difference. If your fingers are up,   there's more of a stretch, if there's, if they're  curled, that's a little bit less of a stretch,   try and keep that arm nice and straight.  With the elbow being straight, that gives   you that better stretch in there. And I'm  feeling that underneath right in there.   A lot of times with the stretches, this is a great  time to do some nice diaphragmatic breathing,   breathe through the stretch. A lot of  times when you breathe in as you lead out,   you can get a little bit more of a stretch  in there. So just nice deep breath.   And as you can see, as I breathe  out, I get up just a little bit more.   And again, once you get the technique down, if  you're pressed for time, you can stretch both   of them at the same time against the wall,  just kind of place your hands on the wall.   But again, I like doing them separately,  because one might be a little bit tighter   than the other. But if you feel comfortable  stretching them both at the same time. That   saves a little bit of time while you're doing it  and getting that nice stretch in there. And again,   if that's too much, curl those fingers, but  you can still get that stretch in there. "
1473,How can I do exercise for stretching the wrist extensors?,17:26,20:06,1046,1206,1596,c0-urMVG8xw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0-urMVG8xw,"going into a flexion motion, this time to get the  extensors which are on the outside there. So that   would be something like a lateral epicondylitis  or tennis elbow, and then that inner one is that   golfer's elbow or that medial epicondylitis. So  this time, you're going down in the motion, and so   it's the opposite this time. So if I want more of  a stretch, I'm gonna curl my fingers in because   those muscles Come on the outside. So curling  them gives me a much better stretch in there.   But if that's too much, I open up those fingers,  and then straighten them out. And that'll get you   just a little bit less stretch, but still a pretty  good stretch in there for that full 30 seconds. Short rate and keeping that elbow nice and straight.   Bending in, curl those fingers if you want just  a little bit more, so that little muscle belly   up top, that's where those extensors are and they  come all the way down through there. Some people   might get a better stretch, if they turn it in.  You might see some people do that even if you   turn it out just a little bit, just be a little  bit aware that some of those positions might be   a little bit uncomfortable. So not going into the  big stretch. If you want to try a couple of those   other positions, I feel like this position gives  me the best, most comfortable stretch in there.   And then shake them out a little  bit if you need to in between.   and then I'll kind of do it across so you can  see a little bit better this time. So fingers   down for a little bit less stretch, fingers  in. Oh really feel that stretch through there. And then I'll kind of crossover again so you  can see the little bit better on this side.   Now just do fingers down this time.   And the same with any kind of stretch. You  might not be able to get your hand down as far   as I'm getting. You know, it might be just to hear  before you feel a stretch. So make sure you're not   forcing that stretch where there's pain, pain,  stretching should be uncomfortable tension,   but you should be able to easily hold it for 30  seconds without going or feeling like you're gonna   "

So you're going to really  feel it, just wrap them around kind of like this.   And all you're doing is trying to open as far as  you comfortably can, and close, nice and slow. So   just the same thing with the resistive bands you  want to do both controlled out and controlled back   in. And you can see a little bit of difference  here. I've had some surgeries on both hands.   So you want to just make sure the reason I'm not  going all the way open is because I don't want   the band to roll all the way down. So you make  sure you're just controlling everything while   you do it. And then nice and slow back in. And  I can really feel that it's just a rubber band,   you still get a newspaper, sometimes there's  rubber bands on newspapers. I don't know how   many people get newspapers anymore, my parents  do. And then out. And then nice and slow back in.   Sometimes they have thick ones on vegetables  when you get vegetables from the, the fresh ones.   And so you can probably find some somewhere  without having to buy any. So just out.   And then nice and slow back. And but like  I said, you can use the resistance bands,   if you make that little loop, you can  put it all the way around your hands.   "
1475,How can I do a towel squeeze exercise for hand stretching?,21:51,23:10,1311,1390,1596,c0-urMVG8xw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0-urMVG8xw,"just put wrapping your hands around the rolled up  towel, making it thick enough. So you get a little   push in there. And just squeezing. And that's  all I'm doing. And then I'm going to hold it   for about three to five seconds, and then  relax. So not squeezing as hard as I can,   you can build up to that. But this is almost  like some of those isometric exercises that   we did in the beginner challenge, where you maybe  start off with just 30 to 40%. And then each time   you do it, you can kind of increase that  percentage. But if you're getting to 100%,   then you'd want to start a different exercise.  And again, if you want to separate it out,   you can do one at a time. But with these,  I feel like maybe it's a little bit easier   to squeeze with one versus the other.  So a little double squeeze in there,   if you wanted to. And you could also have two  towels if you want and then have one in each hand   squeezing. But this is pretty easy to do  as well just that squeeze and then relax.   You can bend your elbows to have mount too, so you  can kind of see what I'm doing. But if it's more   comfortable to bend your elbows, that's okay to  do as well. So now we're going to do some standing   "

And at  the moderate level, hopefully, you've gotten some   strength in there. So I'm just standing on both  putting my feet about hip shoulder width apart,   and we're just gonna do a bicep curl. So just  keeping those elbows by your side, coming up,   and then controlling it nice and slow back down,  I'm kind of starting off coming with my palms up   towards me, I'll show you kind of you can do  like a hammer curl for the second one. But again,   so just nice and slow and controlled. Because I  have the resistance on both sides, I'm feeling   a little bit more resistance because there's more  pull on the band with those. So if you need to do   one at a time, you can definitely do one at  a time. But hopefully by now you're feeling   comfortable being able to do them both at the same  time. So again, keep those elbows pretty close. Now the thumb is going to be up kind of like  a hammer curl style. But make sure that you're   controlling that band. Don't let that band  control you just nice and smooth motion. So   you don't want to just go right back down. One  because you're missing out on the exercise and   two that actually kind of hurt just a little  bit. So you don't want to irritate something   while you're doing your exercise, that's why it's  important to go so nice and controlled with it.   "

This  time, I'm going to bring my elbows kind of up.   Because you're just doing the movement at the  elbow, the top part of your arm stays in the same   position. Now I'm just kicking back so it's not  kicking the whole arm back, I'm just straightening   out the elbows, and then coming back in. So kind  of getting that kick back motion, I might be   moving the top arm just a little bit. But ideally,  you can see I'm bending a little bit at my hips   to be able to get that big push back. If you  feel a little uncomfortable, you can bend your   knees a little bit to undo that kick out, and  then that takes a little less tension off the   resist abantu. So it makes a little bit easier.  So that would be a way to modify it as well.   And if you want make a little harder, with  more tension, you can spread your feet out   just a little bit in those knees to start off  if you want, and then kicking those arms back.   Ideally, you want to get those elbows straight  at the end. But if you just feel comfortable,   maybe getting to hear right now, that's okay. And  then ideally, you want to eventually be able to   get it nice and straight because I can really  feel that in my triceps when I straighten those   elbows all the way out. So there you have it,  those are my general stretches and exercises for   "

1490,How to identify proper shoes for exercise?,00:43,01:25,43,85,211,1srWgkde48w,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1srWgkde48w,"The first thing we want to do is take the pressure off this area. I think the first critical thing to say about this is make sure your shoes fit and make sure there's plenty of room for you, especially on bike shoes which tend to run kind of narrow. You want to make sure there's no compression this way. So always buy your bike shoes at the end of the day. It's actually best to go for a long bike ride and then go buy shoes. The guy in the shoe store may not like you so much, but you'll get a better fitting shoe. The other option is to try on the shoes with two pair of socks. That way you can actually start your ride wearing two pair of socks and then halfway through the ride if your feet start to get numb, you can take off one pair as your feet start to swell. So that takes care of the swelling issue. "
1491,How to identify proper arch supports to place in shoes?,01:25,02:49,85,169,211,1srWgkde48w,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1srWgkde48w,"Second thing we want to do is transfer pressure off of this area. Some simple ways to do that, both that you can try yourself and if that's not enough, you can come in and see us and we can do a better job at, usually, first thing is to use an arch support in your athletic shoes whether they be bicycle shoes, again or running shoes you might use on an elliptical machine. The idea is that you want an orthotic that grabs the arch extremely tight, because we're trying to transfer pressure off of this area and get it onto the ball of the foot. That's what takes pressure off of these nerves. So this is one of my favorite arch supports you can buy over-the-counter. You can find a list of our favorite ones on our website. Go to the website, click on ""Self Care"" and look for numb feet or tingling feet and you can find a list of everything we recommend for this problem. You can even get some sandals, the Vionic sandals that I often recommend that have some good arch support in them. You can wear those around the house, take pressure off the area. But again, the key is to have that arch support in your athletic shoes. If the over-the-counter supports are not enough then you can use a custom orthotic. The advantage of the custom orthotics is they will conform much, much tighter to the arch of the foot. In fact they should be air tight to the arch of the foot in order to transfer pressure from here back to here. This is one we might use in an athletic shoe or running shoe. The ones for bicycle shoes tend to be somewhat smaller since there's not as much volume in those shoes. "
1492,How to test if your sciatic pain is due to the piriformis?,01:49,05:11,109,311,329,4AXP1XW-MJY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AXP1XW-MJY,"But the first thing we're gonna do, is we're actually gonna try to put our fingers on that, and see if one side hurts versus the other. So you could do that laying down, or you could do it sitting up. Do you want to show them? - Yep, so there's that bone, there's the sacrum. - Here's the bone right here he's talking about on the bone. - Right there, it's a sacrum. So I'm gonna go right there. Right in there. And you're gonna palpate around. In other words, kind of poke around on your butt. You might pull up that leg, and get in there and you'll fight it. It will clearly stick out and you'll go, ""Ow, oh, that's the spot."" - [Bob] Some people feel like they're sitting on a golf ball or something like that, yeah. Yeah. - [Brad] And then go on the other side, you can compare one side to the other, and there will be a dramatic difference. - And that's what you're looking for, is the difference between the two, 'cause it's very unlikely, you're gonna have pure piriformis syndrome on both sides. - Right. - So that's number one. Number two, the one that I always see on people is, I'm gonna lay down, Brad, if you don't mind. - Sure. - Is that when you stretch it, you stretch the piriformis muscle, and you'll find one side hurts and the other side doesn't. So first I'm gonna check the left side. So I cross my leg over. So the ankle's a little past the knee here, and I take this knee now, and pull it towards the opposite shoulder. So I'm gonna pull this over. And if that hurts or gives me symptoms, or if it really stretches. I'm gonna compare it to the other side. So I'll bring that one over, pull the knee to the shoulder. And if there's one side that's worse than the other, the one side that hurts then when you're palpating or pushing on, another possibility that's piriformis syndrome. - Right, yeah. So you're stretching it and it's gonna be very clear. It's not gonna be, ""Well, this hurts a little bit more."" It's gonna be, ""This really hurts more."" - All right, the third thing you can do, the third test you can do, you can actually put some resistance against the muscle, and see if it hurts when you do that. Do you mind putting a belt around my knees, Brad? - Yeah. Yes, I do mind but I'm gonna do it anyways, Bob. - That's very nice of you. - Yep, okay, so this is just gonna offer some resistance. It doesn't have to be a white belt, it can be a black belt, it can be gray a belt. - Right, maybe a little tighter than that though, Brad. - A little tighter, okay. I'm sorry. - I gave him one job. Look what he does. Okay. Well, actually I don't want it that tight. (Brad yells) (Bob laughs) - 'Cause you do want to- - See. - You do want it a little bit further apart. He was right. This is probably the first time in his life. In his life, he was right. - Yeah, I'm gonna kill you, way you deserve. - (laughs) Okay, so you do want it far apart like this, and now you're gonna try to spread your legs apart with your feet touching. (shoes clicking) 'Cause you're basically going into external rotations. For you not professionals, right? - Right. So yeah, we can call this the clam shell, feet are together. So here's the clam shell. Clam, ""Nommy, nommy, nommy, chew, chew, chew."" But anyways. So you push out and that's gonna make that muscle work, that piriformis. If it's injured, that's gonna create pain. - Exactly. And the last test, I don't know if you could do this, maybe on your own too. You're gonna bring the leg up like this, and now you're gonna pull it out again. And because at this point it's an abductor, and you do the same thing. You could try it there and you could try it there. - Right. It's a little easier to do with someone supporting here, the therapist. So that's what Bob was referring to, if you could do it on your own. - Yeah. So if you're finding all three of those are positive, there's a good chance you have piriformis syndrome. "

1507,How to treat someone in shock?,01:53,05:36,113,336,342,4-cPuXaZACg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cPuXaZACg,"But if it's an internal injury, if it's a brain injury, a heart injury, we won't know exactly why they are going into shock. We'll just know that they are showing the symptoms of shock. And when they do, we're going to treat it the same way. If we haven't already called 911, we're going to make sure our scene is safe, gloves are on, CPR shield is available, and activate emergency medical services. Then, treat the primary causes of that shock. If they're unresponsive, we're still going to check to see if they're breathing. If they are breathing, fantastic! Now we know we can move to the secondary issues -- bleeding control, shock management, fracture management. In this case, he is breathing, he's pale, cool, sweaty, delayed capillary refill. No obvious signs of external bleeding that would cause us any problems. We can now treat for shock. Primary treatment for shock is laying them down. After we've managed airway, breathing, and compressions, and it's not an issue, we want to make the patient as warm as possible. Why? Keeping the body warm helps it compensate for shock. If it doesn't have to vasodilate in his extremities, that helps it to shunt the blood to the main areas of the body -- brain, heart, the different vascular organs that need to be fed with oxygenated blood to stay alive. Keeping them warm helps that. So, when we do our demonstration, we'll show how we're going to cover the patient with a warm blanket to help them with this issue. And then, if we don't suspect any kind of spinal cord injury or hip injury or long bone fracture, we're going to elevate the legs, making sure to put the box or object to keep their legs elevated above their heart, somewhere around their knees so that we don't hyperextend their knees. By elevating the legs, keeping them warm, laying them down, and then re-assessing them for breathing and circulation, and controlling any other external injuries, like external bleeding, is how we're going to help this person combat the effects of shock and give them a second chance at survival. The scene is safe, my gloves are on, my CPR shield is available. Sir, sir, are you alright, are you okay? He appears to be breathing but he's not responsive. You, in the plaid shirt, go call 911 and come back. I might need your help. He does appear to be breathing, but he looks pale, cool, sweaty, low capillary refill, slow capillary refill, and he's unresponsive. I think he might be suffering from shock. I'm going to elevate his legs. Does anyone know how he got hurt? Any back injuries? We find out that we don't suspect any neck or back injuries. I'm going to elevate the legs, being careful not to hyperextend the knees. Sir, can you hear me? Can you hear me? He still appears to be breathing. I do not see any external hemorrhaging or bleeding that needs to be controlled. I'm just going to maintain re-assessment every couple of minutes and make sure that if there's any problems, I treat them. And wait for EMS to arrive. "

The next step is to rotate your head away, and look away ever so slightly, again, from the area of pain. So, this should cause some muscular tension here, and you should feel the stretch. To help increase this stretch, make sure this shoulder is nice and relaxed down towards the floor, and you can bring up this arm and relax it on top of your head.

Again, you should feel a nice stretch in a slightly different area of your shoulder. To increase this, again, bring your arm up over your head, and use the weight of it to intensify that stretch.

What it sets out to do is increase the motion at the base of your spine, and at the base of your skull. First stage, what you want to do is, you want to push your nose and your chin as far forward as you can. At the same time, you want to keep your shoulders completely still. Then for the second part, you want to imagine a point on the back of your head and bring it backwards as far as you can, again, keeping your shoulders frozen. Repeat that motion, and you can repeat this up to 30 to 50 times. One thing to make sure that you're doing, is that your nose and your chin are in line, so that you're not nodding your head at all, or looking up towards the ceiling. So, it might help to have a fixed point on a wall to focus on. So, I hope these exercises help with your neck pain. "

Lift your shoulder blade up. Now pull your shoulder blade backwards. So far, shoulder blade up, shoulder blade back. Now you're probably feeling some tension in here. Now we're going to add the head and neck into it. For the head and neck we're going to tilt the head backwards. We're going to pull our ear toward that shoulder, and then we're going to turn our head away. If we then bring all that together, for 2 seconds that is a full contraction of the upper trapezius. Now like I said, you may have actually started to get some cramping. If you did, you're going too hard, so you need to just relax. We're going to do that one more time, we're going to switch sides. Usually the way that I train people in this is, you do 2 seconds of contraction, and then you reverse each of the movements. That's what we're going to do on this side to get the stretch. Once again, for the contraction we're going to raise the shoulder blade, we're going to pull the shoulder blade back and we're going to hold that position. We're then going to tilt our head and neck back. We're going to tilt our ear toward that shoulder and rotate our head away. We're going to bring it all together for 1001, 1002, relax. From here, we're going to reverse it. I'm going to turn my head toward that shoulder, tilt my head away from that shoulder, pull my shoulder blade down, pull my shoulder blade forward, and bend my head forward. Once I'm in this position, I'm going to give 5 little pulses and relax. All right? Now if you compare the 2 sides, you did tension on one side, and you did tension and relaxation on the other side. They should be noticeably different. What we're going to do is we're going to go over here and take care of the poor neglected one, but we're going to do the same process again. Just because I want you to know this one. We're going to start with the tension, we're going to lift the shoulder blade up, we're going to pull it back. We're going to tilt our head back, tilt our ear toward that side, turn our head away, bring it together for 2 seconds, 1001, 1002, release the tension. Now we reverse it. We turn our head toward that side. Tilt our head away. Pull the shoulder blade down, bring the shoulder blade forward, and bend our head forward. Pulse. One, two, three, four, five.

You don't have to do it on the floor. and then just take a strap right kind of above the ball of the foot, and pull towards you. so you're not actively moving the foot, you're using the strap. you can use a dog leash. you can use a belt to pull in, and you should feel that stretch right under there where that calf muscle is that actually crosses that knee joint. so that's why it's really important. so now just a little break in between and then go back into that stretch. so this is the second 30 second stretch now. so again the calf muscles, or that gastroc muscle, comes up it's attached that Achilles tendon, comes up and crosses that knee joint. so if it's tight it's gonna cause pressure and pain in that knee if it's not doing what it's supposed to do. so this is just a nice way to really get that stretch in there and get everything loosened up. you want your stretches to be comfortable, you don't want it to be painful. just feeling tension. so now taking a little ten-second break. to get set up for the next one, we're going to go into a hamstring stretch.

I like it. you can keep everything in the same spot, but bring this leg down. keeping that leg straight, again you're gonna come up and now just drop it across your body. try not to lift your bottom up. you don't have to roll all the way over keep that part of your hip down, and you should feel that stretch through the side now. so that's your IT band, and guess what it's another one that crosses that knee joint. so you really want to make sure that you're getting it nice and stretched out. so you can keep everything nice and loose. come back down and then come right back up to get that second stretch in there. so you come up first keeping it straight and then roll it across your body until you feel that stretch through there. now sometimes people feel a little more stretch if they come down a little bit and come over. the crossing the body is what gets that IT band stretch. so if you're not feeling much down here, try coming up a little bit higher and come across. I feel mine more if I can if I bring my leg up higher, but some people feel it more if they're a little bit lower. so your choice. now just take the strap and kind "

So a tight quad can cause a lot of knee pain. so this is just another one to get that "

I can feel that stretch through there, but if you need a little bit more you can kind of lean into it a little bit. just try and keep your back upright. I see a lot of people want to do this, and then I'm not stretching that hip flexor at all. you have to keep your back up and you have to tuck that tailbone in. and then if you want more you can go forward a little. good. so that's it. so there you have it, "

1550,How to sit in a wheelchair when you have a spinal cord injury?,03:55,06:10,235,370,390,mRiJqtOYegI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRiJqtOYegI,"are lying in so that you are changing them often. Proper posture is important for people after having a spinal cord injury. They need to protect their skin integrity by allowing for even distribution of pressure while they are sitting in their wheelchair. Proper posture will also assist in the prevention of muscle imbalances, contractures or tightening that may develop. When sitting in your wheelchair your feet should be flat in the middle of the pedals, your knees and hips should be positioned at right angles, your buttocks should be all the way back in the center of the seat. If your hips and knees are not in a good alignment, this will lead to your trunk flexing forward which can cause increased pressure on your backside and will also lead to your knees rubbing together. While you are sitting in your wheelchair your trunk should also be upright with your shoulders relaxed, your elbows should be resting at right angles on your arm rests. If your trunk and chest area is forward this can decrease ease and effectiveness of breathing and the reaching ability of your arms. Maintaining good head and trump posture while sitting in your wheelchair is very important. Proper posture while sitting in your wheelchair can give you improved use of your arms for wheelchair propulsion with decreased effort and protect your shoulders from injury. If you find that you will need more trunk and head support while you were sitting in a wheelchair you may need a reclining wheelchair or a tilt-in-space wheelchair. These may or may not be power wheelchairs. Be aware of your hip knee and ankle position, make sure that your feet are flat on the pedals with your hips and knees at a 90 degree angle, your knees should not be touching together, also make sure that you are sitting with your buttocks all the way back in the seat while keeping your trunk upright in the center of the backrest and your head is centered leaning against the headrest. When you don't sit back the whole way in your wheelchair you can find that your knees may turn in and there is increased rubbing on those bony areas you can also find that it can be harder to reach things with your arms, take a deep breath or even swallow. Your shoulders should be relaxed so that your elbows can bend and your forearms are able to rest on the armrest. If you have any swelling in your arms please speak with your physician or therapy team regarding any adaptive devices that you can place on your wheelchair to elevate your arms. Please remember that before you are fitted for "

So the first exercise we're doing is neck retractions. That's exercise number one. So basically, you're taking your chin - Your chin tuck. - Your chin tucks. So you're going back. We've showed this one many times. Talk about like a pie in the face. - I thought you wanted me to do a high five, Bob. - Oh no. - Yeah. So yeah. If something's coming at that part, you just say, ""Whoa."" You back up. You know, an option for this, if this doesn't work or it makes a little problem, you can-- - Oh yeah, absolutely. You can do it laying down. - As a matter of fact, I just gave this information to one of our viewers last night when I was responding. And he said it hurt when he was doing the chin tucks in the seated position. Well, make sure you try it in a position like this. So now, the back of your head does sometimes-- - And sometimes, Brad, I even use a little towel like this. It makes it easier then, the chin tuck. - And that position, the change in position, the weightbearing, changes a mechanics slightly. And you may have-- - Not so much chin down, yeah, chin back. - I like it better like this, but you could certainly use something in there. - [Bob] Yeah, it enhances, sometimes. - Even your hand if you don't have a towel roll. - [Bob] Yeah. So if you try the exercise sitting up, and it's painful, maybe try laying down. - Right. - And that's gonna be the same for exercise number two, Brad, which is-- - An important point, Bob, the first time or two, it may not help. But if by the third time, if you start to feel some changes, some things feeling better, then you're gonna go repetitions up to 10. So you need some repetitions in there, but usually not more than 10. - And that's a good point, Brad, because actually, it may hurt a little more even at first for the first couple reps, but it should start getting back to normal very rapidly, and then eventually, it should start feeling better. - Right. If you get seven or eight, and it's not improving, and things are actually getting worse in there, stop. - Yeah, you need to see a therapist then. I mean, it is just no way about it. "

Next one we're gonna do is, actually, we're gonna do extensions, but again, what's good about the chin tucks is it's getting you a good posture. The next one, I'd like you to find a chair with a nice solid back like this. And you're gonna, a lot of times you do a couple chin tucks to warm up a little bit, and then you're gonna go ahead and work on going back. Now, you can go back to the point where it starts to really hurt then back off. - Right. - You can work halfway, go back, and then eventually you want to, the key with all these is to really get back as far as you can. - As long it's making it better. - Right. As long as it's making the symptoms down your arm, or in your back or in your neck, better - Right. Centralization is getting out of there. - You wanna show the towel, Brad? - A lot of times I'll have people and my patients, they'll start doing, the chin tuck is doing good, and then they'll get back to here, and oh, and they can't really do it. So I'll have them take a towel roll, put it here. And with that little bit of support, not pulling hard, but just a little bit of support, and then all of a sudden, oh yeah, that feels better. and then they can go back, and then you can help pull your head up too, a little bit. So in the initial phase, that towel roll can really be helpful. - I do it a little different. I use the edge of the towel. - Oh yeah. - Quite often, I'll use-- - I was taught this way too, and then I just-- - I like the edge on the towel. - There's a name for that edge, but I can't remember it. - Yeah, I think there is. And I like to bring it up actually towards the eyes like this. And then the arms go along with the neck like this. - Yeah. I learned that, didn't we learn that, in Mulligan class? - Could be. Yeah. And then you can go different levels. You can go a little bit lower, a little bit lower, and see how it works with that. Now again, Brad kind of alluded to this, but with all these, you're gonna do the exercise 10 times, and you can do it five to six times a day. I actually tell my patients to do it every hour. - Sure. Yeah. - And the reason I tell them to do it every hour is because I know they won't. I mean, nobody can do everything every hour. They get busy, but they end up doing it five to six times a day then. So that's a good start. Same thing with this one. If this is just too tendered, not working, you can do this off the edge of the bed. You can go off like this, and you can take your hand like this, and you can just lower yourself like that. - This is the one where I really do like to use the towel, the whole towel because-- - Oh, that would work too. - It's a little more control. - Yeah, more control. - [Brad] Again, we can't emphasize this enough. You're only gonna do these if they improve and-- - If they're improving the pain. - And they're gonna improve it by the 10th one, you should feel clearly better than the first one. - Right. Certainly, not worse. I mean, maybe it'll stabilize. Maybe it's gonna take a little bit, but yeah, you'd like to see something improving in the hand, or if it doesn't go all the way to the hand, it's not going into the shoulder as much. - Yeah. If you can eliminate the symptoms of tingling and stuff from here to here, and this is gone, well, that's good progress. - Yeah, 80% of the people get better with this, "

The third exercise, this is the one that helped me, Brad. Let's say having pain on the right side. You're actually gonna do, first you're gonna get into kind of a good position, good posture. And you're actually gonna side bend towards the side - Towards the side of the symptom. - Towards the side of the pain, yep. So chin tuck towards the side of the pain. - And again, we should say symptoms, technically, because sometimes it's numbness and tingling. So we wanna include everything with this. - Yeah, the numbness and tingling might get better. I had a dentist that did this one, worked beautifully. I mean, this didn't work. This didn't work. Went to this, and it went right away, and he had it all the way into his hands. - Did you get some free dental work? - No, I didn't, as you can tell. - The old barter system didn't go over. - So that one works out really good.

Now you can do this standing, but stand in front of a mirror. And you're gonna check your non involved shoulder first. - Good idea. - Let's say my shoulder problem is on my right side, so I check my left side, I see how far it goes up. - It's pretty normal. - So the frozen shoulder most often, it's not gonna even hit parallel. Which is right straight out like that. It's gonna be like that or less when you compare it to the other arm. So this will be like this, this will be like that. - Typically painful or just feeling pain-- - Painful, especially in the first stage, the freezing stage. - Okay. - It could also be an impingement, they'll go in this way. That's why we're gonna check another one. So this time we're gonna raise out to the side, so thumb up, I'ma raise up to the side, I'ma go up as far as I can go. Are you even gonna go all the way up? - Well, I can go that high. - Okay. - I don't know. And then I'ma check with the other side. The other side again, is probably not gonna go any farther past parallel. - It's thumb up? - Thump up right. So and again, could be painful. The last one, you're gonna bend your arms to 90 degrees, like that yep, and you're gonna go ahead and turn them out. Now the non involved ones should go out quite far. But this one, is not gonna go out very far at all. - And keep note the elbows stay close to the ribs. You don't let them go out like this, that it's important for that particular test. - Yeah, if all three movements are affected and you weren't having trouble with your shoulder before just kind of came on. Then I think it's time to see the doctor and get diagnosed but I'm guessing you have a frozen shoulder it's a pretty good sign. "

If it isn't impingement, this will hurt. But oftentimes, if you help with the other hand, once it gets so far up, then it's better up here and it hurts in here. - That's a very good point Brad, if you have a frozen shoulder you can hear it, it's like you're hitting a wall. You can't bring it up there very easy. So that way it may help delineate whether it is impinge if you have question. This is actually they call it the painful arc syndrome, because it's so common. Right in here it's more painful, but if you help or sometimes you can reach through it, and then it comes up and it's not so bad, then it's definitely not frozen shoulder. If you're hitting a wall, that means that capsule has tightened up on you, and both ways and this way it just doesn't want to move. "

I like putting a little roll underneath my ankle right there because then I have movement in that heel. you don't have to, but I think you'll just get a better stretch better movement when you do that or you can just prop it off the edge of a couch or a bed or off of a table if you want to just so you have that movement in there. so take something like a stretch strap or a dog leash, but lots of times it has a loop it works the best. you want to put it around the ball of your foot. you don't want to be high up on your toes because it's probably gonna slip off and you don't want it to be low down by your arch because you're not going to get a really good stretch. so you want to completely relax your foot. you're doing all the stretching or the movement with the strap that you have. so I'm just gonna pull and get that stretch. so right now I'm feeling a stretch underneath where the calf muscles are. so depending on your sprain, depending on how much irritation you have in there, you might not be able to pull very hard. but with a stretch you don't want it to be painful. you want it to be comfortable. so just get that nice tension feeling, but no pain while you're doing this stretch. you will hold that stretch for 30 seconds, relax, and then do that a total of three times. so you can do the stretches several times throughout the day as long as it's not irritating it. so then the next one that "
1657,How to get ankle sprain pain relief with ankle circles?,02:10,03:20,130,200,705,PY10ABRN79c,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY10ABRN79c,"you're gonna do is just what you would call ankle circles. so again having it where your heel is not touching the floor or touching something is best because you're gonna have more movement in your ankle. if I just had it on the floor, I can still do it, but it's just a little bit harder to get that motion in there. so the ankle circles are just exactly how they sound. you're just gonna try to make a circle at your ankle. but it's not your whole leg. you're not moving like this the the leg part should be staying still, and you should really try and get that movement at the ankle because what you're doing is with the spring you're trying to keep that movement so it doesn't scar up and tighten up. but you're not trying to do a lot of movement where you're just gonna irritate it more. so you have to kind of find that happy middle ground. but movement just at the ankles. so you're making I would say ten circles one way and then reverse it and do ten circles the other way. so same kind of thing, you can do ten, you can do two sets of ten of each, but you can do this several times throughout the day as long as you feel like it's not irritating it even more. so you just have to depends on what grade your sprain is. it's a little bit different for everybody. so then the next one is just using something like an "
1658,How to get ankle sprain pain relief with ankle wraps?,03:20,06:27,200,387,705,PY10ABRN79c,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY10ABRN79c,"different for everybody. so then the next one is just using something like an ankle wrap. and ankle wraps are really great because not only does it give it a little bit of a support, but it also gives you some compression. so if you have some swelling in there it helps work it out. so I'm going to use the ankle wrap from braceability, and this is their neoprene ankle wrap, and it's really nice because again it's not a brace per se, it's not gonna stabilize your ankle, but it's not just to give compression in there. and so all wraps or some sometimes they are called braces are a little bit different. but most of the time it wraps around your ankle and then you have two straps that kind of cross. and so that's usually the way most of them work. they've got a little opening for your heel which is nice because you can just kind of put your heel there and get your foot flat on the ground. now generally if you're sitting that's a little bit better because you want to have your ankle kind of in that neutral position. if you can get it there I'm just a since I'm on the floor going to show you this way, but you usually start the wrap at the bottom / so you can get that nice and stabilized. and so then if you wanted to put your heel up like that you can again to get it in that neutral position. so it's not sitting down like this it's nice and tucked and then you're going to come and bring the part up around your ankles. so you want it to be pretty firm but you want to be able to easily slide two fingers underneath because you don't want it to be so tight that you're cutting off all circulation, but you want it to be pretty firm. so then you're getting that compression you need to get that swelling out of there. and a lot of times that compression just feels really nice. it's just like a hug. I usually like to do the inside strap first because that just helps hold up the arch, and you're gonna cross it over. so you're making that cross pattern and then you're gonna take the other one and cross it the other way. so then it gives you that a little bit of a support right there through the ankles. so again it's not necessarily a brace, it's not stopping the movement. you don't really want to stop the movement unless you've gone to your doctor and they want you in something that's actually stopping it because movement is gonna help with a sprain. you don't want to completely not move it unless you've got a really big sprain like a grade three or something and your doctor has told you not to mobilize it at all. but see again this works really well because it gives you that support that you need but then it also just kind of helps with that compression to get that swelling out of there. so if you're interested in purchasing the wrap or anything else from brace ability, make sure and click on the link up there. so I'm gonna go ahead and take this off to do the rest of my stuff. a lot of times people do ask that I wear the wrap or should I wear the brace while I'm doing the exercises. I personally, if you're doing therapy type exercises, I would say no. if it's if it's not increasing the pain while you're doing it, you want your muscles to really try and do the work. if you're wearing that wrap, maybe if you're doing something a little more high level, you know maybe trying to bike or run or something like that, that's when you have the wrap on there or just in general to get that swelling out of there. but if you're doing your therapeutic exercises, if you can I would do it without them.

All you need is tap water, heavy-duty freezer bag with the Ziploc. - Gotta be a heavy-duty one. - Yup. It should be. If you just use a Ziploc bag, more chance of it busting loose. - It's gonna crack, or... - Right. Bust loose after time. I mean, you can if you want to. Okay, so. - So one way, is what you're saying, is just water? - No. - Oh. - If you just use water, it's gonna turn into an ice block, Bob. - Sure. - Then you try to put an ice block on your shoulder. It'd be like taking this, this freezer pack. You buy it downtown for your cooler for picnics and you put it on there. - Doesn't really conform, does it? - I've had patients use these at home, and I say, oh no. You can use that, but what we have is much better, and they're cheaper. - We want something that's gonna envelope your body. - Exactly. No matter where it is. - Right. - So get yourself a gallon freezer bag. You can use a quart one if you want a small one, that's fine. A cup to measure water, right out of the tap. - Gotcha. - And then you either use salt, just regular old baking salt, you know, that comes in, salt in your food. - Sure. - Or you can use rubbing alcohol. - Okay. - Okay? - I didn't know you could use salt. - Oh, yeah. - This is new to me! - Well, Bob. - Wow. All right. - [Lonnie] (indistinct) Measurement? - Well, we're getting to that, Lonnie. Lonnie brought up a good point. What is the ratio? - Okay. - Okay, with rubbing alcohol. I didn't want to make it in front of everyone here because I didn't think it was necessary to make a mess, but have someone hold the bag open. You can do it by yourself. Put one cup of water, one, two, three, four cups of water. - Four cups of water. - One cup of rubbing alcohol. Put it in there. - So, four to one. - Right. Get the air out. You gotta kind of go like this, this, and get the air out, and zip it shut. And then, mix it up a little bit so it all dilutes. And then you take another bag and put it in another bag, so you double bag it, okay? And then you put it in the freezer nice and flat and leave it overnight or for a few hours. And then you'll have a slush. These are moldable cold packs. - Sure. I've seen these, and I mean, they work really well. "

Go ahead, Bob, you got one. And there you go. Freeze it. That's water, but it's hard. (knocking on cups) Ice, okay? Peel off, go ahead, Bob. Peel it off. Yeah, you can't do it. You gotta expose the ice. - The upper part. - Yup. Okay. And then you can have some sharp edges. Rub it a little bit. - So you rub it with your palm. - Now, a cold pack will take 15 to 20 minutes is what's recommended to cool the body part down. This? Five minutes. - Oh, less than that. I mean you can go five minutes, but in two minutes it'll be cooled down. - I always say five minutes. It usually takes a minute to acclimate, and after a couple minutes, Bob is right. It's starting to go numb. - Yeah. These are really good for smaller surfaces. So like, you got tendonitis, elbow, golfer's elbow, tennis elbow. Really good for shoulders. It works out really good for that. I would say, even if you're having tendonitis of the knee, works out really good for that, because again, it's just gonna... - Now, with this, you know with a cold pack, you should put a piece of cloth, like this towel, a thin towel, over the body part, and then the cold pack. Because you don't want to frostbite your skin. - Right. If you're going over clothing, you'll be fine. - Right, exactly. Any kind of cloth, anything. But with this, you don't have to do that, because there's a layer of water, so you'll never frostbite your skin. - You probably want a towel underneath you, because it does start to - - It gets messy. That's what's going on here. And after about a minute, so two minutes, it starts to kind of snap, crackle, and pop on your skin. It hurts. But once it gets past that and it goes numb, and then it's good. - And you can usually tell by just taking two fingers like this and it feels like one? That means that it's adequately gotten cool. - Exactly. "

But he's actually pulling down. And you can work a little bit on the level that you're putting it. But, generally we just start right at the base of the neck. And what you'll find is, a lot of times, without the towel, you can't do it, it just hurts too much. And most patients I have, have to use the towel to start. - Yeah. - And they always seem to really enjoy the fact that all of a sudden they can start moving back. And you may not be able to go that far to start. You'll be able to go farther than without the towel. But yeah, just take the movement that it allows. So, maybe for a couple days you're only gonna go about 50 percent of how far, the total amount. But eventually, you want to see if you can get further and further. So what Brad is saying is, a lot of times, you start, instead of just going back, we start getting your posture correct by chin-tucking, tucking the chin in, and then going back. 'Cause what we don't want is somebody going like this. So that's why we chin-tuck and go back. - If we're not having good success with this, - So, we're not having good success with this. - If we're not having good success with this, then the next step, I'm sorry, Bob. I can't just let you do all the talking. "

A little closer. - A little close, oh, how about that? Hello. And then, - He's gonna use a belt. - A strap that has cloth, versus a shiny one. - Okay. - Oh these are sensitive. Bob, I'll let you go. - All right, so he's got, I mean you can use a belt, too. I mean, I've done it with a belt, actually. What Brad was saying is it's nicer if they're very thin because then you can really get on to specific levels of the neck. 'Cause sometimes you'll find out that it works out really well quite low. Sometimes it's better doing it further up. And so you can vary and figure out which level actually works for you. How do you know it's the right level? It actually feels better. - And more range of motion. - And the more range, right? It's gonna allow you to move further. So right now, Brad moved it up a little further. And, there you go. About an inch at a time. And he's starting to pull down. Yep, and now he's starting to get more motion. All right, so Brad's mentioned that all three of the people he worked with, there was definitely a specific level that worked better. And one was up higher, yes. And I found that myself sometimes, but yeah, a lot of times normally the stress is on the lower neck. But I've seen it myself too where sometimes, are you getting feedback? You're hitting the mic, Brad. - [Brad] Oh, I'm sorry. (laughs) - Okay. And now he's actually gonna go the other direction. And this is a different variation. The joints actually are angled like this. So he's gonna kinda go along with the joint itself. And then he's gonna actually, when he's going back like this, you can see his hands are moving along with him. He's not just doing this. He's not doing this, now go back. Yeah. He's going with it. The eyes are staying level with the fists or the thumbs. So, this is another variation on how you can do it. That's a good cue. So he said if you put the thumbs out, they point right into your eyes and they should stay with the eyes. And again, you can try different levels using the thinner strap. But this one, I'd start with the thicker one. Got the mic here. You start with the thicker one. - I'll go back. - He's going back on. And then usually if you can try a thinner one, "

So if it's the right shoulder that has the knot, then we're gonna lie on your left side. - You said it right, Brad. - Well, Bob, I've been practicing at home. - Can I have, two pillows probably. - Yeah we're probably gonna need two pillows. - All right and I can still palpate that area too in this position. - 'kay can you see that, Mike, in the camera? Or are we getting off. - Should I move back a little bit further like this maybe? - That might help. Now, the thing about this is it's a positional release and the position of your head and shoulder is very critical. The whole idea, the muscle basically starts here and goes up to the head and we wanna shorten that muscle as much as possible. And the whole theory is neurologically that's going to allow the muscle to relax, which is gonna increase circulation, blood flow, and oxygen which is gonna allow that knot to release. And you'll feel that when that get that circulation going, everything feels much better and it carries on. So now we got the theory, we're gonna go back to the practice. So, Bob is going to take his head, if this is a painful side, he's gonna side bend right ear towards right shoulder, okay? And then he's gonna look away from that shoulder, rotate- - No, I'm gonna stand first aren't I? - Well we can extend, not really far. - A little bit, little bit. - Yep. - So I'm bringing my head back a little bit. - Yep, exactly. Sorry, good job, Bob, thanks for correcting me. And then look away. So this is kind of an awkward position and then we need enough pillows so that you can relax and maintain that position. Now you can palpate again if you feel that painful spot dramatically decreases when you touch it, this is all the farther you have to go. Then you have a timer and you hit the timer or you look at the watch on a clock on the wall, you know, has second hand or whatever. And you go for 90 seconds in that position, it's critical you go at least 90 seconds in order for things to release. Now, if you palpate and still feel sore, then we're gonna add shoulder or scapular elevation so the shoulder goes up towards the ear. You may want another pillow for this arm to relax. - Or you could even go up like this. - Yep or you can reach over the top like this.

1674,What exercise will relax my neck and upper shoulder muscles?,02:19,04:55,139,295,596,PPdAIKwXe-Q,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPdAIKwXe-Q,"when you're having that soreness from you know  either muscle knots or just neck pain in general   is a levator scapulae stretch. and so that levator  scapulae muscle is the one that elevates or lifts   our shoulder blades. and so a lot of times when  we're stressed out, or when we're starting a new   exercise program for the first time, we end up  getting that muscle really tight because we're   bringing it up like this, and that overworks that  muscle. and it starts down at that shoulder blade   or that scapula and goes all the way up into  the neck where those cervical spine um the   muscles are up in there. and so that's per that's  those cervical spine muscles. so this is a great   one to stretch ou.t sometimes there'll be a knot  in it a lot of times it will be right down there.   and so a great way to stretch it out is if you  comfortably can, on the side that you want to   stretch, you're going to kind of bring your hand  back to that shoulder blade where you want your   elbow to be up as high as it can. now if this is  a little bit tight for you, you can bring it here,   but this just kind of helps hold that shoulder  blade down so you can get a better stretch. so   you don't have to if that's uncomfortable. you can  still kind of put your hand underneath here, but   this is the way i learned and this is the way that  i always feel like i get a the best stretch for.   so now this time you are going to turn your head  almost like a 45 degree angle like you're looking   at your opposite knee or like you're going to tuck  your nose into your opposite armpit over here.   so take your other hand and bring it up behind  your head. so you're not coming to the side.   you're not pulling it over. this time you're  coming at an angle. so i like to put it behind   my head up and over almost like a helmet on there,  and then so you're going to pull down and in. so   like you can see almost like i'm trying to take  my nose towards my armpit, or kind of that nose   down towards the opposite knee. so again you just  want to feel a little stretch. it should be kind   of up in here a little bit higher up now in that  area you might feel it down at that shoulder blade   kind of getting that angle. sometimes you might  have to adjust a little bit to get that stretch,   but it shouldn't be painful. it should be a  nice comfortable. a little bit of tension,   a little bit of uncomfortableness stretch, holding  that for 30 seconds. and again if you have time,   i would work both sides because those muscles all  come up and connect to the spine. so arm up this   way and then pulling down, almost like you're  tucking your nose into your armpit or kind of   at that 45 degree angle while you're stretching  there. so after you get that, you can shake it   out just a little bit. another one that tends to  get really tight and sometimes get some knots or   "

I like just kind of sitting on it and that just keeps this shoulder down, so I'm stretching this side, this is the side that I want to sit on. then I'm just gonna bring my hand, my other hand up and over, and I just want to keep my head in a neutral position. so I'm not looking down, I'm not looking up, I'm just pulling straight over to the side. and I should feel that stretch kind of right up and through here, and that's where that upper trap comes into that neck. again you don't have to sit on your hand or push it down, but you'll get a better stretch that that just gives me a nice stretch feeling that. and so this is going to be a full stretch. so you're holding it for 30 seconds, come up. again even if you feel like usually one side as a side that you need, I would stretch both sides because the neck those muscles on each side really have you know when it's connected to the spine, you want those both to be flexible and mobile so they're not causing imbalances. so 30 second holds, doing that three times on each side to really get that good stretch. so the next stretch is the levator scapulae stretch, and the levator "

And it elevates or levates that shoulder blade. and so it's really important because a lot of times if you're working really hard on a computer or you're focusing on something, you tend to tighten up like this, and that causes a lot of pain in that neck, and feels like you know sometimes you got to crack the neck to get that relief in there. so this is a great stretch to do. so to start off with this one, if I'm stretching this side, I'm gonna bring my arm up and try and take my elbow towards the ceiling. now if you can't do this if this is uncomfortable, that's okay. some people will just raise their arm you can do that as well, or you don't have to put it up here, but again if I put my hand here, I'm pushing that shoulder blade down or keeping it stable down there to get a better stretch. now this one is a little bit different because I'm gonna take the other hand and put it behind my head. I'm gonna pull my head down at about a 45 degree angle. so it's not coming straight down, it's not going down towards the side, but I'm turning my head so my nose is going towards the opposite knee. so this one sometimes people don't quite get but it's coming bringing my hand behind my head and bringing that nose down towards the opposite side. so I should feel that stretch right through there. so it shouldn't really be on the side like that upper trap, it should be a little bit more in the back. and if you're not quite feeling it, turn your head a little bit more at that angle and pull down. so again this is another thirty thirty Seconds stretch. you're holding it for thirty seconds, and again I would do both sides. turning that head and that nose pointing towards the opposite elbow and coming down holding it for that thirty second stretch doing that three times on each side. again just keeping everything balanced and even. and so that's really nice way to loosen everything up. and so the last one is "

Bob you're in my way. - I think it's always good... - They can't see me. - I think it's always good to have a pillow underneath. - Oh, that's a good idea. - It'll show up better too. Oh yeah, how's that Lonnie? Good idea. - But they call this like the flexor wad. - Right. - And working on that, without a doubt, I think is really helpful. And you generally, I think find that to be sore too, Brad, don't ya? Quite often? - Oh yeah. And you'll find knots in there sometimes, - Yeah. - that feel like ropy. Sometimes if you can find that ropy knot, the rope would be kinda like going this way, 'cause a... - It's good as a preventative thing, even. Wouldn't you say, Brad? - Oh, sure. - I'm sorry, I was cutting you off there. - That's all right, Bob. (Bob laughing) I'll let it go this time. But yeah, so you can get under with your thumb. Once your thumb gets tired, then it's time to gets you with your knuckles, cuz they'll last longer, and you wanna loosen those muscles up. You'll probably do this for five minutes. By that time you'll get tired of it. - Sure. Get carpal tunnel on the other one. - Yeah. And then if you want to get into the cross-friction massage, that's gonna get up in that area. - Right. - But if it's really tender and flared up, you have to wait for the right time. - Right. - You gotta give it some time, might be a few days into it. - Generally I found, Brad, you're gonna be a little bit off the bone. You're not generally gonna be on the bone itself. Just a little bit off of it. - Yep. And again, what has happened is the tendon has either torn, or it's got frayed. - Sure. - And you're actually gonna go in there and you're gonna actually, and it's got scar tissue that's laid down. - It's starting to scar in, - Yup. - because it's healing itself. - And then when you use it again, the scar tissue breaks open. So what we're trying to do is do a massage to make those fibers strong and lined up again. - Right. - Right now they're like a cobweb aren't they? - Right. So we wanna, to be honest with you, Bob, I don't quite fully understand it, but (Bob and Brad in unison) it works! - Right. (Brad laughing) These are all theories of why it works. - Right. But you're gonna get it, right there is a bone. You'll feel that the really pointy bone, you get into that, and then you're gonna get over the sore spot, and you're gonna work back and forth. The fibers go this way, so you're going 90 degree across from it. And you're just gonna work like this. - And he's rubbing hard. - I'm getting in deep. - Yeah. - If you can zoom in Lonnie, you'll see I've got, I got wrinkles on my skin. Not from aging process, either. While he's using thumb, he can use also two fingers. - Yup. - He can go like that or thumb, or finger on top of finger. - Mm hm. - And again, you're gonna go for, I mean you can do this a long time, but generally what I do is break it up, ya know, maybe do three, four minutes at a time. - Right. - And then later in the day, do another three, four minutes. - And you'll know this is the right thing to do, because after the first minute, it's gonna start to feel better. If it starts hurting worse, you need to give it a break, give it a day or two, and get some ice on. - Yeah, it should start to numb up or feel better, or like Brad said, (indistinct). - Right. Not numb from the ice, but it actually kind of feels numb-ish from the rubbing. - Right. - It's that sensation. - Yeah. - So, and once you get to that phase, "

Pendulums are really my favorite type of exercise or / stretch for any kind of tightness or stiffness in the shoulders. so if you haven't had a surgery, if you've just had some tightness you don't necessarily have to do this passively, but if you've had a surgery you really want to do this where you're not actively moving your arms. so there's a difference there. so if you have a surgery make sure to check with your doctor, physical therapist before doing any of the exercises, but all you're gonna do then was my left shoulder that was tight and stiff, I'm just gonna hang it down and then I'm gonna use my body. but I can actively move the shoulder a little bit just to make circles. so I'm just gonna kind of make a circle like this going around. I probably do about ten one way and then switch it and do ten the other way. if that feels good, great. sometimes what makes it feel a little bit better is if you just take a small weight and place it in your hand. this is just a soup can. usually they're about 1 pound, and so then you just do the same thing. so just kind of let your arm dangle down and then just make a little circle kind of use your whole body. so you're not just swinging your arm, but you're using your whole body to swing and then reverse it. you can also with the pendulums then just do like a side to side. so again you're still using your whole body, and you're just letting that arm hang down, and the weight just kind of helps open up that joint which usually makes it feel really really good and it loosens it up. so if it's stiff in there, this is a great way to kind of warm it up and get it loosened up and get some of that stiffness out of there. and then you can also kind of put one foot back and then just rock back and forth. so you're doing that front back motion as well. so let's just do maybe like ten of these. if you don't want to count you can do 30 seconds to a minute and you can do these a couple of times a day. so then the next one is gonna be using a pulley. so I'm gonna set "

1828,How to treat stiff shoulders with a long stick?,03:40,06:31,220,391,714,TIvREhFgho0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIvREhFgho0,"it's gonna allow you to do that motion passively. so then the next treatment is an act of assistive range of motion with a stick. you can use PVC pipe if you have it with some pretty tape on it. you can use a broomstick. if you happen to have a cane you can use that as well. you just want something kind of solid where you can assist the other side going up. so that's what that active assisted range of motion means. so using the stick is really nice as well because again then you're not doing the whole movement on its own, you're using the other side to help again and that's really good because if you can relax those muscles once again you're probably going to get more motion because if there's something that stiffness that tightness in there this is gonna really help. so you can do again the flexion, abduction, external rotation, with the stick. so the first one if it's still my left side I'm just kind of letting the left side go for a ride. so really this is the motion that I'm doing with my right side, and this one's just kind of hanging on. so it's getting that free ride with the other side. but since this active assistant you can kind of you know help it up a little bit too but a lot of the work is being done with this side. so you might only be able to get right here and that's fine. so when you're doing this one with a stick, I would say just do a little pause maybe two three-second pause as high as you can get, and then cut them down and then maybe just start off with ten. you know one to two sets a couple times a day. you can also do that abduction out to the side. a lot of times I like the little hook here which would be something like a cane or you can rig something up like this because then you can kind of just hold it on the end here and then use this hand. so you're going to be pushing up this way now and again the arm is just kind of going along for the ride. most of the time I like the thumb being up, but if you just really want it to be kind of completely relaxed that's okay to hold this way, but if your thumb is in that upward position you're not going to impinge it quite as quite as much. so just going up like this, again just going as high as you comfortably can. this one might not go quite as high is that flexion, but it's a really good way to kind of get that stretch without just actively trying to lift it up on your own. when it's still hurting you can also do some external rotation. if that shoulder is really stiff you want to keep that elbow by the side and the same thing just kind of grab onto the end or on that hook, and then you're just kind of pushing that motion out that way. make sure you keep your elbow by the side for this one to get that that true external rotation. if I'm doing this, that's not really the external rotation you really want to kind of keep that elbow by your side and then do that push. so again you can do a little hold there at the end or if you want to kind of do that continuous motion to get that stiffness out of there, you can. so that really works out well. so then the next one is "

"

1831,How to treat stiff shoulders with chest stretches?,08:16,09:19,496,559,714,TIvREhFgho0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIvREhFgho0,"throughout the day and that should really help it out. so the next one is going to be a full stretch for your chest or your PEC area. and again all these muscles here come and attach to the shoulder, so when you have that stiffness in there a lot of times your shoulders roll forward and it's really important to get those stretched out. you can stretch your your PEC muscles in a couple different ways. you can stretch it in a corner. you can stretch it on a doorway and kind of step through, but if you don't have those options a really easy one is just to take your hands and kind of clasp behind your back. I know sometimes this is hard for people, so maybe if you have to hold on to something like a towel together to hold it you can do that as well. but if you can clasp them together, you want to do that. and so what you're gonna do is kind of push down and out a little bit and while you're pushing down and out, you're gonna push your chest forwards. and then you're just going to hold that stretch and you should really feel that stretch right and here through the PEC area. so this one's going to be a full stretch, thirty seconds. and then you want to do that stretch three times. so the last treatment is going to be table "
1832,How to treat stiff shoulders with table slides?,09:19,11:33,559,693,714,TIvREhFgho0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIvREhFgho0,"want to do that stretch three times. so the last treatment is going to be table slides or you can do them on a ball I'm going to just sit down and kind of show you on a chair because that's easier to do in here, but it would basically be simulating you kind of sliding on a table. so for the table slides, I'm just demonstrating on the chair here because it's easier for me to do, but this is something that you have a table, a countertop, a coffee table any kind of flat surface will work. I like using a towel because it helps slide a little bit better because again you want it to be a pretty smooth easy movement to get that stiffness out of the shoulder. if you use the towel, make sure that it's it's a sliding really well but also when you're doing the movement keep your thumb and an upward position. and just what that does is it opens up that shoulder so it's not in an impinged position. so if you can try and keep that shoulder up when you do it. and then you're just gonna kind of slide forward. so again if you're at a table or a countertop you might have a little bit more room but still if my shoulder is tight I can even back up just a little bit and get some stretch in there. and see I'm pretty getting a pretty good stretch through that shoulder and just kind of leaning into it and then coming back. so it's just like it sounds. it's a table slide. and you can again you know do 10 at a time couple sets of 10 a couple times a day. and you can also do different angles as well. so I'm going to turn a little bit I'm going to use my other side just so you can see, but like if I wanted to do that abduction so then I'm still sliding but now I'm coming at that angle so I'm getting that Abduction motion. you can also come at an angle forwards where you're not completely forward you're not completely out to the side but like a 45 degree angle and that's called scaption. and so that's a really nice one to do as well. so you're just sliding and the point of the table or the flat surface is again to kind of make it an active assisted motion where you're not completely holding your arm up in the air getting the stretch, but you have that table or that surface to help kind of support it. so then you're not having to use all those muscles that might cause extra stiffness in there. so there you have it, those were my top "

Step 2: Pull the ear gently towards the top and back part of the head. This straightens the ear canal which is normally curved so the drops can fall as deeply into the ear canal as possible. Step 3: Squeeze the correct number of drops into the ear after the bottle has been shaken and warmed to body temperature. Step 4: During and after drop placement, pump the tragal cartilage in order to force the drops as deeply down into the ear canal as possible.

I'm just going to use one pillow. We may need another pillow. It's really important that you do this in a relaxed setting. It's best by yourself. You're going to lay down and what we need to do is get that bicep in a relaxed, shortened position. So, we're going to supinate. We're going to flex the elbow and we're going to flex the shoulder, so we get way up into this position. - Now, you see it's probably a short as it could be in this position. - That's the goal. - Now, because we have a small plinth here, there. But on a bed or a floor, you're going to get a pillow here, here, and at this point, you may want to move your elbow back and forth. And what we're looking for is a position of maximum comfort of where the injury is. So, once we shorten that muscle. Again, supinate, flex the elbow, flex the shoulder, and then we find a position that's really comfortable and then adjust the pillow so that you can completely relax that arm. Let's say the pain, when you're here and you're moving it, you get to a six or seven pain on the painful area, wherever it is; when we shorten it up, what we're looking for is a pain level of, hopefully, two or below. One or zero is perfect. And once you find it, then you get your timer out and it's critical that you're going to hold this position in a very relaxed, relaxed breathing, everything's relaxed for 90 seconds, not less than 90 seconds. You can go longer, but not less. So, hit your timer and just hang out there, a nice, quiet breathe. And you're going to go for 90 seconds. Now, we're not going to hold it for 90 seconds for the video. Do that on your own. Put it on hold. - Sure. - Go ahead. You can go up to 120 seconds. Now, it's critical when you're done with this is that you just don't open up quickly. You come up and let things extend and lengthen that bicep slowly. Take your time, get up. You're not going to lift weights after this, or do any chores that extend or stress that bicep. You can do a gentle massage on the muscle to keep it loose or where the tendon is. "

You want to make sure that if there's something that put this person in this position, you don't want that same thing to put you in the same position, because you're not any help to anybody if you're also unconscious. And then, you go up to the person and you say, ""Are you okay? Can you hear me? Everything okay?"" You know, kind of like we see in the movies, ""Annie, Annie are you okay?"" You want to check to see if they're breathing, if they have a pulse, and you can check on their elbows, on their wrists, on their neck. Up here you can check on their neck. If they are, then you want to see if there's any other kind of trauma. Were they hit in the head? Was there anything nearby that may have hurt them? Did they trip on something? Is there anything around? Is there alcohol all around and maybe they just had a lot of too much fun last night. Something like that. You want to make sure you can see what's around and if you can try and figure it out. If you suspect any kind of head injury, especially neck injury, if you suspect any kind of neck injury or spinal injury you're not going to want to move your friend. Okay? Keep them as they are, still. Call 911 and wait for help. Monitor to make sure that they're breathing, that they have a pulse and stay on the line until the ambulance gets there. If the person is vomiting or there's fluids coming out and you feel comfortable that there wasn't a neck or a spine injury, then you're going to want to put them in the recovery position. And the same thing again, you're going to want to bend their knee, roll them over and then bring their arm over this way. And that way their head is to the side and any kind of fluids, or vomit or anything that's coming up will fall out of the mouth onto the floor and they won't choke on it. The recovery position is very simple. I can't say it enough. It is very simple. It can save someone's life. If someone's unconscious, you just lift their knee, roll them over and roll them to the side. It can save your friend's life by just one simple move of rolling their body over to "

Swallowing exercises may also be recommended  to help strengthen your ability to swallow. At mealtimes, shut off the TV or radio to focus on your meal. Sit upright when eating and drinking and for at least 20 to 30 minutes afterwards. Eat and drink slowly and take small bites and sips. Swallow all the food in your mouth before taking another bite. Use your tongue to clear out food on the weaker side of your mouth.  If you are helping at meals; sit at eye level, place the food close by to encourage the person to feed themselves, if possible. Someone is too tired or not alert, it is better to wait and eat later. Medications can make you less alert or lead to a dry mouth making swallowing more difficult.

Let's go with hip flexion. - Okay. So flip hip flexion means you're going to take your knee and bring it to your chest. So that's bending the hip or flexing it this way. And you might find out this knee is normal or this hip, I'm sorry. - That hip, yep. - And this one, oh, it gets tight in here.

How about internal rotation? - Oh, this is the one that, you know, you just taught me this one. - Yeah. - Because this was kind of hard to do, but both knees up like this. Now I'm going to stretch my right leg, the one closest to the camera. I'm going to take this over, my left ankle over the top of the right knee. And I'm going to pull it away from the camera. And this really does a nice job on this part of the hip. And you know, you can adjust here. You can move your foot to get whatever feels like a good stretch. When you've got a good stretch, it's going to feel like, ""Boy, that's doing a good job."" You may have, if you have some mild pain but it feels like, ""Oh, it feels like it hurts so good."" Or when you get done, it really feels good, that's gold. - Yeah, you can bump up against the pain but don't go into the pain. - Right. - You can do this sitting down too. You can cross your leg over and pull it like this. And so I'm giving a little bit of stretch like that. You could even go like this, just work it this way.

That means is whenever you break a bone, big or small, you have to stop the motion at the joints on either side of that bone. This may seem like overkill, but the only way to really treat a broken toe is with this: a big walking boot. Now, a lot of people think I am little crazy when I say this because it just looks so big to treat this little broken toe right here but the problem is that not only do you have the motion here but you�ve got tendons that is start in your leg and go down in your toe and those cause motion of the toe, so a taller walking boot like this is the only way that you can actually stop the motion of those tendons and stop the motion of the foot. Because this boot has what is called a rocker on it, it prevents you from moving it. So getting into this boot as soon as possible is the best way to treat it. First of all, if you do stub your toe, I highly recommend you try not to treat this yourself, go see a doctor, get an x-ray but then make sure you get a walking boot. You can find more information on how to treat a broken toe on our website, just do a search for broken toe. If you have no ability to see a doctor, you can actually find recommendations on the types of walking boots you can use there but otherwise, again, get an x-ray and see someone about it but get into a walking boot. Do not let them tape your toes together to try and treat a broken toe. "

The clinical presentation of Kawasaki disease can be remembered by the mnemonic CRASH and burn. C is for conjunctivitis, R is for rash, A is for cervical adenopathy, S is for strawberry tongue, H is for hands and feet, which is to say swelling and erythema of those parts. B is for burn, which is to say fever. The diagnosis of classical Kawasaki disease can be made clinically based on the following criteria. Fever for five or more days and at least four of the five clinical features from the CRASH mnemonic. Conjunctivitis, which is typically bilateral and nonpurulent. Rash, which is a polymorphic rash that can be seen on the trunk, extremities, and groin. Adenopathy which is cervical and unilateral, with the node being at least 1.5 centimeters in diameter. Strawberry tongue, or erythema of the tongue with prominent papillae, as well as erythema of the oral mucosa and lips. Changes in the hands and feet, which may include swelling and erythema in the acute illness. Periungual desquamation occurs two weeks after fever onset. Patients who have less than four of the five principal clinical criteria who have fever with coronary abnormalities can have incomplete Kawasaki disease. "

If a rash is present, describe it. The rash of Kawasaki disease is most commonly maculopapular, but may also be morbilliform, targetoid, or scarlatiniform. It is never vesicular. Are the hands and feet edemitous? Are the palms and soles erythematous? Is there any ischemia? Complete a thorough HEENT exam. Is there conjunctival injection? Are the lips red or cracked? Is the tongue red with prominent papillae? Is the oral pharynx erythematous? Is there a lymphadenopathy, and if so, is it unilateral or bilateral? How big are the nodes? Are they tender? If the lymphadenopathy is diffuse, this is more suggestive of a viral illness. It is also important to perform cardiac, respiratory, and abdominal examinations, although the findings may be nonspecific for Kawasaki disease. "

So with the first part we're going to focus on rotation. We're going to take our towel, roll it up, and just place it on the shoulders for now. Find the spot that really is achy and causing a lot of pain. What you're going to do is take the towel and place it over the level of that spot, and just put a little bit of pull in there. Whatever side that it's on is the side that you're going to then lower and lock that down towards the chest. The opposite side, so in this case my left side is hurting, my right hand is what's going to do all the work. I'm going to just slowly try to rotate or twist the head towards the left until I feel a very good stretch. Don't force this one, just go to the point where you feel a good stretch. Hold that for about 10 to 15 seconds, come back, and then just keep repeating it. Go a little bit further each time you do, until you feel like you have a lot more motion in there and the neck is starting to have a lot more mobility into it. So if you are having a lot of pinching pain going on, we can take this stretch to the next level by doing a self traction in there. This one, we're going to cross the arms. Whatever arm is on top, you're going to then go up diagonally, so almost towards your eyes. You want to lock the bottom hand and then take this hand upwards with it, almost towards the eyes. Again, hold this one for 10 to 15 seconds in a spot you feel comfortable, and just keep repeating it. You should almost feel an upward traction into the neck, and that will help relieve a pinched nerve. Give it a try. "

So whatever side pain you're having, just throw that towel on that side. Next, I'm going to reach backwards, I'm going to grab the end of that towel and then I'm going to take the other end and go diagonally with it. So I want to go across my chest towards the right side. I try to line it up with the spot in the neck that is really feeling a lot of discomfort. So I'm going to go right over that spot, pull it over towards the right, and from here what I'm going to do next is then bend away while putting pressure into that towel -- and this is a really good intense stretch. I hold that one for about 10 to 15 seconds, I come back up and then just keep repeating it and try to go a little bit further each time.

This is one's that you check out to see if you get relief from a position. So let's say I'm having pain in this arm here. - Yep. - I'm gonna put it on a pillow and support it. - Sure. - and then I'm gonna tilt away. And now I'm opening the holes up here. There's plenty of room now for the nerve to come through. It's being supported. And does this give you pain relief? Well, if it does, then you may have a nerve issue. - Yep. - And that's actually, a lot of times with people that have nerve problems. I actually have them use a pillow, all the time. - Sure. - Because it provides some relief. Even if it's a shoulder problem too. - Right. Exactly. Now that one it's possible, if I got a patient and they do this and it hurts down here or this, sometimes that way will pinch it more. But if it's a bulging disc that might actually push it out a little bit, too. - It might. I could make it worse. But generally I don't think it pushes it out enough to cause a problem.

I mean, back pain and herniated discs have become a problem of prolonged sitting, not lifting. Can I have a rolled towel, Brad? - You bet. - So one thing you're gonna wanna do is when you're sitting in your chair or in your car, you're gonna wanna make sure that you ... Just wanna gimme one of those. That's fine. - [Brad] I got a roll. We lost our rolled towel, Bob. - A lot of times what we do is we take a towel and we roll it up and then we put tape on it. We just put like duct tape on it. That way it holds in place. But you can take a rolled towel. What's nice about this is you can vary the size. With some people, especially when they're having a herniated disc or a bulging disc, oh, you found it, they want to have a larger towel. I found that with people that they tend to like and then over time, as it feels better, they go to a smaller towel. - Right. - Put it in the low back around the belt level. You'll find out where it feels the most comfortable. And that's gonna put a little bit of arch in your back and that's gonna help prevent that bulging disc from becoming a herniated disc. - Lot of the car seats now, Bob, have some pretty good lumbar (indistinct). I've had patients-- - Support, yeah. They have the, my English. I've had patients that had nice lumbar supports and didn't even know it.

The other thing you wanna make sure is that probably limit your lifting and also lift correctly when you are gonna lift. Exactly. This type of lifting, when you're bending the arm back like this, this is what helps push that disc out. So you can even bend your knees and still lift incorrectly. See how I'm rounded out here, Brad? - Yep. - So do you wanna use the stick real quick? - Sure. - Not that you have a stick in place or with you but this will give you a good visualization. If I'm lifting correctly, there's contact points on my head-- - Here. - mid back and low back. I'm lifting correctly now. I keep it all straight. If I'm lifting incorrectly, there's only one contact point. - Gap here. Nothing here. - Even though I'm bending my knees, I'm still lifting incorrectly. - Puts much more stress on that area. - Yep, and that's gonna turn your bulging disc into a herniated disc, so let's get those two things in place.

We have lots of videos on this, but usually what you start off with, you're gonna start off in what we call a prone position on your stomach. And you might start off just by laying here a little bit. You let your back straightened out. Some people can't even lay flat like this. Sometimes they have to have a pillow underneath them to start off, Brad. - Right. As a matter of fact, should we show that, Bob, so they really do it gist of it? Just take a pillow right about at the waistline and that'll make it feel better, tolerable. - I've had people that had to use two pillows. And then, eventually they were able to work away from that, get away from the pillows. And then eventually, they could get up to this position on prone on elbows, the prone prop here. And then, eventually, we start putting the hands underneath the shoulders and we start doing press-ups. Can you see how that might push that bulge back in, Brad? Can you visualize that? - Well, I can. We'll hope that our viewers can, but it's-- - It's bringing the bones together. So it's helping push that back in. - And we've got some other videos, if they look at that model and try and visualize that. - Now a herniated disc, you may have to do some other things, which are kind of some more advanced methods. But with just a bulging disc, quite often I think you can just do press-ups like this. - Sure. - And then, eventually you want to get all the way up here. And at some point, sometimes, you need to even do a little over pressure with a belt or with a rolled sheet. - Yep. - Do we wanna grab a sheet? - Sure. - Okay, so you take a sheet and you're gonna roll it up. - That's done very well. Like a tornado. - I didn't really do it that well. - I know, but you did. You have done it well in the past. - I've tried. And then, so you're gonna go long like this. And now, you're gonna use your hands to actually give a little over pressure here and now I'm gonna stretch it like that. - Can you move this elbow so you can-- - Yeah. - There you go. Try it again. So the sheet is actually locking down and putting support on the low back and that helps push that bulge back in. - As therapists, sometimes we actually put our hands on their back and do it. - Oh, yeah, you bet. - And provide the over pressure. - But don't have your spouse do that to you or your children because they might not know "

And this is usually after I've been standing and I'm, you know, in that, more of an extension mode, but I won't hold it for minutes. Usually, you know, 20, 30 seconds at the most.

The core muscles are all the way in the back, but this is what you wanna really become dominant so they protect those vertebra from shifting again, and I've been doing these for, let's get the ball, could you, Bob? I've been doing these for approximately five years now on a fairly consistent basis, and actually I've improved quite a bit from four years ago. - [Bob] Yeah. - To having back pain every day, to now just when I do silly things and abuse it (chuckles). But I'm trying to avoid those things. Sorry, I got my brown shoes on today. I usually have my black shoes. Some commented on that, Bob, they were not happy with that. - [Bob] That's not good. - Yeah, I know it. - [Bob] That's bad (chuckles). - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I was in a hurry. But this is a great exercise right here. Forces a low back and a good posture, it really works the abdominal muscle as well, and you get some hamstring and some hip strengthening as well, okay? And then I'll just go in this position, and this just feels good, and I'll work the core from this direction. And if you're starting out with these, probably 10 will be good and you're gonna get some sore stomach muscles. You know, if you're fairly fit, you know, you'll build up. I usually do 50 of these, and then I stop, and I have a little more of a routine than that. Then, the third one I do is here and here and I double it up, the double crunch. And I'm thinking about lifting my buttocks up in the air because that will help flex that low back, those low vertebra, and get those muscles in the front strong, okay? And then the final one, this is one of my favorites because not only does it strengthen your core, and you get the oblique muscles on this one, but right here under your back, with me anyways, it scratches my back and it really feels good. So I do the (groans), the criss-cross, elbow to knee, opposite knee, and you do those until you get so, your muscles get fatigued, and those are a wonderful tool, and I really am an advocate of using the ball because it protects your back from overdoing it. - Yes it does. - Otherwise your back can arch in the opposite direction. It will not do that with the ball. "

It's rotating like this So this one only goes this far, but this one goes all the way there Could be a sign of a little bit of arthritis, that's a nice thing with all these tests is you got two shoulders If they were both reasonably healthy before the injury, You test from one to the other and say I'm not sure if that's a good sign or bad sign. Test the good shoulder and see what happens on that. You certainly could get arthritis of both shoulders though. Well that is right. "

So this is the one that, by the way I'll have to maybe link up to one of our videos on how to treat impingement, because if I were to take a guess if you're having shoulder pain this probably is playing a role So just one simple test that you can do on your own is you put the arm here again But this time just bring the elbow up like this, and if that hurts and gives you a little bit of pinching, So you're lifting with the other arm? Yep. Keep this one planted on. So you're getting the chromium and the humerus to come in and pinch And that's where it gets the name impingement because you're internally rotating it so it's pinching those tendons. "

Number eight which leads to tendinitis which we taught. This can lead to tendonitis, the impingement So usually what we see with this is like a painful arc we call it. We see this a lot. Yeah, like from here to here It doesn't hurt but from here to here ow ow because it's pinching and It's pinching on that tendon and sometimes it's kind of interesting where here to here it's fine, and then ow it hurts and then they get through that and then up here it's fine again. Right, it's because the tendon clears. The part of the tendon that has the tendonitis actually cleared That's a really good sign of tendonitis is if it hurts in a painful arch, and then doesn't It's one of a few things that does that Yeah, it's kind of interesting, but we don't want to get in the mechanics of it now But you know maybe we will in another video.

Number nine if you have an unstable shoulder, now if you tend to be double-jointed in other joints like let's say you can take your thumb and put it down to your forearm Elbows hyper extend or your knees are hyper-extended There's a good chance that you might have an unstable shoulder because that means your shoulder is not stable either and we do the apprehensive tests which not a really easy one to do on your own, but we bring it like this and we go like this So if I do it on Brad, and I would push it this way He gets apprehensive about it because he's worried It's going to even pop out of the joint. So in other words there's no pain, but it's like just really afraid of letting go, you don't like it being up in this position You can have an unstable shoulder without that being the problem, but It's moving around too much, it's sloshing around and giving you problems "

You're gonna need, you know, a wife, a spouse, or someone - A friend - A friend, you know, someone you take off the street to help you out here. So Brad's having pain and he's having pain down the right leg, okay? - The right side. - And you're wondering is it coming from a herniated disc? Very simple, you're gonna do what was called a straight leg raise. There's a French name for it too but you don't need to know that. - No, we're not, we're not gonna-- - Okay so what you're gonna do is you're gonna have the toe straight up and you're gonna go ahead and lift it up. Now this is, you're doing the lifting, Brad's not doing the lifting. - I'm relaxed, just-- - You're relaxed - --completely relaxed. - Now, if he has a herniated disc, quite often what I have seen Brad, and I'm sure you have too, they start feeling it almost immediately. Right at 30 degrees here already. If he starts feeling it at that point, it's a fairly highly positive sign that you have some encroachment on the nerve. - Right, maybe-- - It might be a herniated disc, it might be the foramen, something. - Sure, something else. - Now you can go up higher - And if it is hurting down there, by this time it might be too painful. - Right, you might not even be able to go this high. Some people may be able go this high and start to feel it here. That's fine, because even at less than 60 degrees or 70 degrees, it's still more likely to be a herniated disc. Now what you can do, now, you wanna distinguish between this and just plain old stretching. People are gonna feel stretching with this too. - Right, could be hamstrings or-- - Yeah is it getting worse in the back? Is it getting worse down the leg? Is it going into the foot? The numbness and tingling, is it getting worse? But you can go up this far and then you can even back off a little bit and then you can go ahead and and bend the foot forward like this. - Right. - If that makes it worse, it's a good sign it's the nerve being encroached upon. - And one thing like when Bob was doing that. Go ahead, let's say, I feel a little pain here. And when he does that, oh it hurts more but it's in the calf. - Right. - Then you don't know, but if you do that and it hurts up here - Yeah - Then you're almost certain it's a nerve. - Here or even in the thigh more but it's gonna stretch the calf. And so, so again, you just start off very simply, you bring it up, start to feel pain already. Good sign it might be a herniated disc. Go up here, still feeling pain. You can go up as high as you'll go then back off a little bit and then bend the foot forward. And if that increases the pain, especially in the thigh or back, likelihood to be a herniated disc. - Right. - And you wanna do it on both sides. - Right, yep. Do a comparative. - Yeah do a comparison and if he finds out this one yeah no pain, no problem, and that's often a good indication. - Sure. - Gold standard of tests. Anybody can do it I think. - Be medically smart. - You know, it definitely takes some practice to get better at it but you know, you can play around with it and if it's a bad one, you'll see. - Yeah, and then you can go to your doctor and take it from there. - Right. - All right. - You can say I did the straight leg raise on myself and it's positive. - That's right (chuckles) - The doctor will roll his eyes. - Yeah.

So the first thing I want you to do is do not play into the flexed posture. Even though it feels better I want you to stay as straight as possible. We want to keep that spine as straight as possible. Whenever you do any lifting or bend it all should come from the hips. You want the movement here. This should stay as straight as possible. If you are already flexed a bit or bend over, we're gonna start you on pillows here. Or prone. - Right, and if you've got sciatica from a disc problem this is gonna help with that as well. This can be a little tricky. This is not a straightforward thing. So we're gonna go through some detail on us and there's gonna be options and you'll see what works best for you. You'll know what works best because it feels better. - Pain, we don't want to increase pain with any of this stuff. This lady, I had her start on three pillows like this and she couldn't tolerate less than this. I mean if we took away any one of the pillows eventually we were able to get down to two, and then one. But she never got down to zero. But this is just a great stretch, you know. Relax for five to ten minutes. If you can, you can put your chin up on your fist like this. But the idea is eventually to re-stretch your back so that you can get back to straight again. - Right, we've gotta get, there's a string on your shirt. We can't have that. - All right, next we're gonna take out a pillow. We're gonna work our way down, it's a simple as this. It might take a couple days, you might be able to do it day one. That's gonna be up to the individual. But you want to get as straight as possible. If possible, you do want to get down to this. And maybe even this. - Now you'll body will let you know. You'll either have a back pain or if you develop pain down your leg, numbness or symptoms, those are big red flags that means you're going too fast, go back to another pillow and give it some more time. - Well Brad has spondy, can you lay like that? - I can lay flat. It's not real comfor--, after a few minutes it's not comfortable. I don't lay on my stomach very much at all. - Right and I think it's okay for you to do for three to five minutes, right? Or maybe three minutes, whatever it allows you. But look at Brad, you have good posture, Brad. You're not crooked, you're not bent over. - When I got back to here it's a little uncomfortable. When I go back farther and I repeat that I'm going to have a back ache the next day. - But you're keeping as straight as possible, that's part of your deal. And you have a grade two? - Yeah, it's grade two. - It's fused now. - I hope so. I haven't had x-rays for a few years, but it feels much better so I feel comfortable. - I think he's a great example of someone who again, that followed these tenants to keep as straight as possible despite. - Right, posture, posture.

Now we're gonna show you a simple way to do it. It does involve a purchase. You need to get the hanging handles. And we're gonna have a link below about where to purchase them. Less than 50 bucks, but these are great. I use them all the time. I just have them in my office and when I take a break it's just a great way to decompress the spine and actually good for the shoulders, too. - If you had a pull-up bar you could do that. - You can do a pull-up bar, that would work too. This is just a great thing because it kind of keeps your back supported at the same time. So want to go ahead and show it, Brad? - So back up against the wall. - Again obviously these are going to have to be put into a stud. It comes with these anchors, too. It comes with the whole device here. - Yeah, this is a nice thing. You're going to have it level so that when you're standing you can grab here and you're not hanging. And you're gonna see I'm just gonna slowly go down. And as you do this, this should not create any pain and should just feel like a really good stretch. And if you have sciatica you may even have a point where as you get the traction on your back the leg symptoms and pain gets better. And if that happens it's gold. Then you're gonna want to hang 20 to 30 seconds and do that repeatedly as long as the leg pain goes away. - You can do it in shifts kind of here. And what's nice about this is you can do it every hour, or every 20 minutes, whatever you want to do. I even try this, Brad, sometimes. I even do it this way and do some hanging. I also have done it where I hang. Of course, I'm taller, but you actually pick your feet up. But you can actually just do gentle rotation if it feels better. If it doesn't feel better you don't do it. - Right, all these are with caution. - These are great for the shoulders, by the way, too. We had whole videos on that how we can help decrease shoulder pain, too. - Those impingement problems. I'm gonna hang a little bit more, Bob. I'm just gonna hang out. - All right, we'll go to the next one, number four. "
2190,How to perform nerve flossing to treat sciatica and spinal stenosis?,08:07,10:56,487,656,847,GbJgE0LPKCk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJgE0LPKCk,"- All right, we'll go to the next one, number four. Okay, the fourth thing we want you to do is some nerve flossing. And this is for the sciatica, basically. It can help desensitize the nerve if you're getting pain down your leg. Basically we're trying to pull the nerve from one end while releasing it from the other. Now warning, this can make your pain worse. If it does, I mean we're gonna have you try it once, do a set of 10, wait a day and see how it did. If it got worse you're gonna wait another week before you try it again. - Sure. - If it was the same or better, then you can keep doing it every day at least once or twice a day for 10 reps. - Sure. - So let's go ahead. You need a high table or a bench where you can swing your legs a little bit. They can swing underneath. - Like here, this gets in the way so that's not good. But I can go out a little bit. - Yeah, it's not bad. Same with mine, I'm kind of hitting this bar right here. - I could go past it when I make an adjustment on the table. You probably can do some kind of adjustment. You'll see once we do the exercise. - So you're gonna straighten the side the leg pain is on, I can get it out, Brad. And at the same time you're gonna extend your neck. Wanna make sure you completely extend your neck. Don't just move your head like this, move your entire neck like that. So straighten the leg, extend the neck, and bring the toe toward you. Then go down, we're gonna show it slow right now and then we'll pick it up at the speed. Go down, flex the neck, flex the knee, and put the toe down towards the floor. We're going up, straighten the leg, extend the neck, toe towards me. Going down, flex the knee, flex the neck, toe goes down to the floor. Okay, we'll pick up the speed here a little bit, Brad. See if I can talk fast, too. Okay, extend the neck, extend the knee, toe towards me. Going down, flex the knee, flex the neck, toe goes down. Extend the neck, extend the knee, toe goes towards me. Flex the neck, flex the knee, toe goes down to the floor. We get the idea, Brad? - Yes, be careful with it. If it's not comfortable, you get some pain with it or the leg pain gets worse, maybe if you've got sciatica or a disc problem that's so bad that this isn't tolerated, stop doing it. It should feel reasonably comfortable. And like Bob says, wait 24 hours, see how it responds to it. - Yeah, you can try it again in a week and if it's still stinging you you've gotta forget it. You've gotta do these other things if you can't do that one. "

These are always great to strengthen the core, but you want to strengthen the core without really bending the core of extending the core. - Trying to keep that neutral posture. - I'll show the first one here, Brad. This is a great one for you want to strengthen the front, sides, and back of the core. So we're gonna show you a real simple one. You can put your hands underneath your back, underneath your spine to give it support like this. And you're gonna lift your elbows and you're just gonna raise your head towards the ceiling, right towards the ceiling. - You see how when Bob comes up I can just get my fingers under his shoulder blades. And then you know you're abdominals are working well. - And you can start off, I don't know, you can start off with a set of 10 or 20. Do whatever you tolerate. This should not increase your pain at all. - [Brad] If you have never done sit-ups before, 10 is going to be probably enough. - Probably plenty, right. "

You want to show a beginner side? This is just a side plank. - So you're just gonna bring your feet out about two feet from the wall. Keep them together, keep your body straight. Don't let it sink in like this. And tighten up that stomach. The leaning against the side will activate the side muscles. So you get the side of the muscles engaged. And you can stay here for 30 seconds or so. Probably best to do both sides so you get even. - Now if that's too easy for you, you can go ahead and try on the floor. So all you're gonna do is bend your knees like this, your elbows like this and you're just extending your butt. I mean you're extending your legs here. - Getting in line, tighten up everything. Make sure you breathe while you do this. - What I do is I do sets of 10, Brad. I count to 10 seconds, relax, then do another 10 seconds. I do like a set of four. I just don't do that many, but that seems to be enough. "

Is the pointer dog. You're going to be in this position here and you're going to slide your leg back while raising the opposite arm. Now if this is too hard for you to start off, you might just want to start with the leg, or you might just start with the arm. But I'm trying to keep the back real straight while I'm doing these. How am I doing, Brad? - Good, good, you've really got nice posture Bob, I'm impressed. Wow, you've been practicing. - It takes a lot to impress Brad.

So I give it a little bit of extra juice. You always wanna be safe when ordering online. Your foot gets just a little bit wider during the day and just a little bit longer. And remember, everybody makes slightly different shoes. So it's always better to go a little bit bigger. So draw out your foot, measure it. It should be in inches, if you're in America. Other countries such as Europe may use different sizing measurements, especially if you're in India or Europe and hello to our visitors from those countries. So give it a little bit of extra. See how I gave it a little bit extra? Then go to a place like zappos.com. They have great calculators. Also a great shoe store.

If you think about that, when you're sleeping, you're really good. So what you need is a night splint to actually hold it. - A neutral position is basically a right angle. This and this forms a right angle, 90 degree angle. - normal position is here. Normal position like that, this will hold it up like that. - Right, okay. This is no kid, If you don't have a night split, and you don't wanna spend the money, have the money, I had a doctor that I worked with and he did this, he took a pair of high top tennis shoes. And he wore them to bed at night, because it kept his feet in that 90 degree position. And it works. These work a little bit better. They're a little more comfortable. - I used to do that, actually, with some of our stroke patients, even. - Oh, really? - Wear the high top tennis shoes. - Sure. Now, I'm not gonna tighten this up on Bob, just because I don't wanna take the time for the video, but the straps go across, getting the heel down in. Okay, and then you can adjust a lot of these. On the better ones, you can adjust the amount dorsiflexion, or where you put the foot, okay. (Velcro rips) And that's what these Velcro straps are here for. - And obviously I would probably put it as tight as it's still comfortable. I mean, I could sleep with it, but I wanna put as much stretch on it as I could tolerate, wouldn't you say, Brad? - Sure, but yeah, again, it's gotta be comfortable. - It's gotta be comfortable cause you can't sleep otherwise. - Exactly, you should be able to sleep at night. - Cause I actually feel a little bit of stretch on my calf right here. Just with this being on. I think I could sleep with this, but I feel it. - And if it is, you can loosen it up a little bit. - Right, cause I mean, you might find out it's like, oh, I just can't sleep, it's stretching too much. And go ahead, you can do this over the period of several nights. Where you try to incrementally bring it up further and further, so. - And you will find a difference when you get out of bed without this, And then the next night with it. It's gonna be much less pain when you stand on it. - And optimally, hopefully what's gonna happen, eventually, is that it'll help it heal quicker. You're not going in that cycle of breaking open the scar tissue and then having to restart the healing process again. - Now, there is one thing as a therapist, I know I cause problems between spouses. And you know, if you put one of these on and they kick the person next to you in bed.

But just simply extend the wrist and flex it. And just work it back and forth, and start out slow if it's tight in one direction, go, say it hurts and it's tight this way, don't push it, just kinda work into it, back and forth. And after about 10 repetitions, it starts to loosen up, then you can give it a little overpressure each time. - As long as it's, it doesn't increase your pain. - Right. If you do it each time and the pain gets better, clearly improves, then you can go a little bit, but use good judgment. - Some people will do it off the edge of a table. - Sure, yup. - So you can support the forearm. - Right. - And yeah sort of a little pressure on, pressure off, pressure on, pressure off. I heard one instructor say, ""Don't enter the pain cave, stay out of the pain cave."" - That's a good way to think about it.

I like doing it for a certain amount of time instead of reps because then you can just kind of go at your own pace. if you have to slow down a little bit you can, and then you can even challenge yourself by saying, hey you know I did maybe five this round, tomorrow when I do I'm I'm gonna try and do seven. so you can kind of give yourself a little goal or a challenge while you're doing it to make yourself work a little bit more. so now I just switch sides, so it's around my ankle on this side. coming up you really want to get your leg as straight as you can. and sometimes even if you pull your toes up that helps kind of lock everything out as well, but if you're only coming to here you probably have too much resistance in your band .you really want to be able to come up, so even if you don't have a band at all and it's challenging don't use the band. just do that knee extension or that long arc quad. so now we're gonna go into bringing "

Take an oatmeal bath. This can be very soothing, especially for blisters or oozing skin due to chickenpox, hives, poison ivy or sunburn. Moisturize your skin. Choose a moisturizer free of additives, fragrances, and perfumes. Apply cooling agents such as menthol or calamine. You can also place your moisturizer in the refrigerator to help achieve this cooling effect. While you are treating your skin, follow these tips from dermatologists to help prevent your skin from itching. Bathe with luke warm, not hot, water and limit your bath or shower to just 10 minutes. Always use fragrance-free lotions, soaps, and detergents to minimize irritation. Be wary of products labeled unscented, as they still might have chemicals that cause irritation. As directed by your dermatologist, apply medications before moisturizing. Then, apply your moisturizer to all areas of your skin, including areas treated with medication. Wear loose-fitting, cotton clothes. Wool and other rough feeling fabrics can irritate your skin, causing intense itching. Avoid extreme temperature changes. Maintain a relatively cool, neutral humidity environment in your house. "

So again, with dynamics, you don't  want them to be jerky movements, you want them   to be smooth movements, but a little bit quicker,  so your hearts gonna get going a little bit more,   you're going to be moving a little bit more with  some of these.

And so it's kind of like it sounds,   you're going to be making a team movement  with your arms out in front of you.   So again, if your shoulders get tired as you go  along, take a little break in between, you don't   have to do it the whole time. But if you want to  try and do it the whole time, you can go maybe go   a little bit slower, if you're getting tired.  So a tea just opening up, you don't have to go   too much further back besides just the plain of  your body, but you're just going out and then   just making those nice smooth movements, no real  pause. You know, this is not a static stretch,   we're not holding it anywhere. But we're just  kind of getting these movements here. If this   is a little uncomfortable for your shoulders, if  you want to bring the T down just a little bit,   that's okay, you can modify it some, but try and  bring it back up as you go. So if you've already   watched this a couple times, and you know what to  do, and you just want to follow along, you can put   the mute button on and put on some of your own  music because you know, I'm going to be talking   throughout the whole thing. So I can show you some  modifications and everything. So if you want to   listen to your own music, because you feel like  you've got it down, that's fine, just making sure   that it's a controlled movement, so it's not so  fast that it's jerky where I'm making the muscles   uncomfortable. And again, if I want to take it  down just a little bit, I can do that as well. "
2305,How to do arms up with the twist exercise for improving upper body dynamics?,07:10,09:42,430,582,1282,lIingaUTg6I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIingaUTg6I,"even though we're doing both sides throughout  the whole movement. So arms are going to come up,   and then you're rotating down, and then coming  back up. So again, you can see I'm following   everything with my eyes and my head, just to get  that whole movement in there. If If you know your   neck is getting a little tired with it, you don't  necessarily have to do it, you can just kind of   move more your eyes in your head. But  this is really to get that whole rotation.   So you want to move your trunk and your head  at the same time as you go making that movement   in there. And then again, if you need to stop  and take a breath, if you need to do an extra   the 30 seconds, now you're just taking  a breath, that's okay, you just again,   go at your own pace, don't try and wear yourself  out too much, especially if you haven't been   doing a whole lot, maybe sitting at  home a lot in front of the computer.   Same thing here, if you feel like this is a  lot, you can just kind of shorten the movement,   still get that rotation, but you're not going all  the way down. So sometimes that's a little better,   maybe if you have some back issues, and it's  uncomfortable to twist that far. You could also   again, with this one, bend your elbows a little  bit to take some pressure off of the shoulder. So   I'll show you with this one, instead of bringing  your arms all the way up. Maybe we have them here.   And I'm still rotating and bringing them down.  But I'm keeping my elbows bent and not bringing   my arms as high up. Because sometimes that's what  causes that stress on the shoulder. So again,   if you feel anything that's starting to get into  that pain range and not just tired and fatigued,   either modify it or just go ahead and take that  extra break and skip those for a little bit.   And so again, I'll do the the full ones this  time. And again, you can go slower and just do   a couple at a time. You don't have to go as fast  as I'm going. But eventually, you want to be able   to make it a pretty smooth motion coming up and  down. But if you need to kind of pause, reset,   come up pause again. You can definitely  do that and pausing and resetting each   time just getting that nice motion in  there. Or pause a little bit lower.

2306,How to do trunk rotations exercise for improving upper body dynamics?,09:44,12:27,584,747,1282,lIingaUTg6I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIingaUTg6I,"So now we're going to go into some standing stuff.  So just kind of getting in a comfortable position.   Now we're just going to do some trunk  rotation. So with your arms, you can kind   of put them where you want to. Sometimes I'll  just use them like just Bring my body around   to give it an extra, I'm just kind  of twisting this way. If you want to   have your arms down, and you're really just using  your trunk to do rotations, that's fine as well,   you might feel a little pop, while you're doing  this in your back your upper back or even in   your shoulders or neck area. That's okay. A  lot of times, that's just your body either   adjusting a little bit or is the fluids moving in  your joints. I know a lot of people like to argue   which one it is. But I think there's times where  it actually might be one versus the other. But I   think both do happen. So again, you can use your  arms a little bit with this one, doing, you know,   if I get my arms into it, I'm getting a nice,  bigger rotation, I feel that stretch in there. But   you can see if you look at my knees, when I  rotate over, I'm bending, I'm unlocking them just   a little bit to get that extra stretch in there.  And then, especially if you have some knee issues,   unlocking those knees really help as well, just  to kind of get that nice movement in there.   Where you can see, again, this is a continuous  movement side to side, I'm not stopping and   holding that stretch, that's more of a static  stretch, this is that dynamic movement,   get your heart flowing, you might hear me  getting a little bit out of breath. And,   you know, it's not that these are big, crazy  movements, but I'm talking through the exercises.   So that does make it a little bit harder. But  again, you know, you're just breathing through   these exercises, and going at your own pace. So  even if you have to kind of again, stop here,   then go maybe do a little pause, you know,  ideally, you want to be moving the whole   time with the dynamics, but go at your own  pace and make sure that you feel comfortable.   And then for the next one, if you don't want  to use your arms at all, you know, maybe your   your shoulders have gotten tired out a little bit.  And so now, I'm just going to move my body kind of   just going like this, even though it might look  kind of kind of funny, but it's like you know,   you're just turning around looking behind you,  making sure nobody's sneaking up on you. So   again, and you can see I'm still kind of unlocking  those knees just a little bit, when I'm turning to   make sure that I'm kind of protecting all those  joints that are getting the movement in there.

2307,How can I do modified jumping jack exercises to improve upper body dynamics?,12:33,15:20,753,920,1282,lIingaUTg6I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIingaUTg6I,"So the next one is just going to be a modified  jumping jack, if you've done this a couple times,   and you want to go into the full  jumping jack movement, that's great,   feel free to, but this is really just a modified  jumping jacks are a lot harder than they seem.   So this is just a way to modify it where you're  really still getting that upper body movement,   but it's just kind of adding a leg kick out while  you do it. So you're mainly just kind of stepping   out and one step on my phone. But just kind of  reaching that foot out as you go. So for this one,   it's still the upper body is what you're working  on. So I would think more about your arms than   your legs. If you know this is maybe challenging  for your balance, if you have some balance issues,   you can just stand in one place and do it. And  you can see I'm keeping my elbows bent for this,   if you want to open your arms all the way up  and do that, you certainly can, but I find that   you know keeping those elbows bent a little bit  just makes it more comfortable on the shoulders.   But if you want to make big huge movements with  your arms a task comfortable for you, you know,   really swinging them up to get that dynamic  movement, that's fine, you can definitely do   that. And you can see I'm kind of turning my head  to the side, I'm kicking the leg out. And again,   that's getting, you know helping with the dynamic  movement for the whole upper body. So your neck   is getting involved as well. And again, those neck  muscles and those shoulder muscles are usually the   same muscles just connecting on different ends.  So it's nice to kind of get that movement going   at the same time. And again, go at your own  pace. If this is a little tiring for you   take a little break in between,  take one of the 30 seconds how to   go a little bit slower. still making those  movements but maybe not quite as fast. Even if you have to stop in between. Shake it out.  Come up again take a little break. That's fine   too. If you want to even do the arms a little bit  lower. So you're still just making the movement   but not going into that bigger movement  again, where it might really either tire   out the shoulders might be uncomfortable for  the shoulders, you can definitely modify it   again by going just a little bit, just kind of  bringing them up into that stop sign position. And again, if you don't want to even do the legs,  you can just kind of start off with this motion,   getting everything going, and then  kind of working your way from there. "

As you can see,  I'm alternating which arm goes on top,   you don't necessarily have to, but  definitely, you know, change it up Psalm,   you don't have to do it every time. But it makes  a difference of that stretch that you're getting   in the shoulder. So really kind of opening back up  and closing in. So almost giving yourself the hug,   but you're not staying long enough to  really hug in there, getting that movement.   And again, this is one where if having them all  the way up at that 90 degree level, you can go   a little bit lower. So this time, I'll kind of  almost going in a downwards position, eventually,   you want to bring it all the way up. But again,  this is a way to modify it. So you're still doing   some movements, but not quite going high up where  you might really get tired or fatigued your arms   out. So there's always a way to modify something.  So if you don't feel like you can do something,   always check in with your physical therapist,  because they can show you some ways to modify it,   even if you just go see him for one session. And  again, you make sure you're nice and relaxed and   doing it taking a little break in between letting  those muscles reset a little bit. Even if you have   to go not all the way back out. So maybe I'm just  kind of crossing out in front of me. So I'm doing   this movement. Again, this is kind of a way to  modify it, if opening up is either really tiring   or maybe uncomfortable right now, you can really  just kind of cross them in front of you. Again, this is really just to get you moving, get you not just sitting in  one spot all day. So a modification is really   just as good as you know, doing the full movement,  because we just want to get you moving. That's the   main thing. He might not be sweating by the end,  but you'll definitely go, yeah, I'm glad that I   did some kind of movements because I feel  better. And I feel a little bit looser and   not so tight. But eventually, if  you can, you really want to open   your arms back up. And really kind of even if  you want to touch your shoulders when you come in   each way if you've got that much flexibility in  your shoulders, really to kind of get that extra   push at the end. But again, you're not really  holding it there. Just a really quick pause. "

You can breathe out  with your blowing out through your mouth   or blowing out through your nose, whichever  one you like I it depends on how tired I am   at the end. You know, if I'm feeling a little  tired, sometimes I like to breathe out through   my mouth kind of with my lips pursed a little bit.  But if not, you can just comfortably Breathe in.   But when you breathe in, really take  in that air and just try and lengthen   that spine when you come up. So I won't  talk as much with the next couple ones. So again, a way to modify this is it this is  uncomfortable going all the way up, still breathe.   But not bringing your arms  all the way up and over.   Eventually you want to get there you want  to get all the way up and over. But if you   you know feel like that's a little bit too  much for your shoulders. You've been doing   a lot already. Again, there's ways to modify  it so you can even bend your elbows and do it.   Still getting that breathing in there.   kind of almost bringing your head down  with your arms too, but eventually and then relaxing and taking  a breath so and you can go   super slow. I'm continuously going through it, but  even if you want to slow it down a little bit so   so you can take that nice deep breath, my  breathe out through my mouth this time. "

So our large  intestine runs up around and down. We're going   to be massaging that area to try and promote  movement through that area. You can use the heel   of your hand. You might use a fist, you start at  the right side of the pelvis so that bone there,   lifting up through here to the rib cage,  underneath the rib cage and across and   down. That's the pattern we're going to  be following when we're lying down. Now,   let's do that together. So coming back down,  all right, so in this position now, use either   the heel of your hand, right side of the hip, lift  up, pressing in gently but firmly, take it across   under the rib cage, and then taking it down  and press. And just go again, across we come,   lifting up, and you might like to use a  fist, see if you can go a little bit deeper,   and you try to keep this comfortable the  whole time, but just promoting some movement   through that bowel. And then if you'd like to, you  can use your fingertips both hands, and you can   often find firm areas – it feels hard, it feels a  little bit hard under some areas of your fingers,   and you can just do some circular movements  with your hands over those areas of firmness,   and often you'll feel those areas release  as well as you start to get some movement   through the bowel. And I can hear  checking my tummy growling a little   bit there now just doing that, across to  the other side, massaging around and down.   And you can do this as often as you like,  particularly, if you're resting in bed,   and you might like to also combine it with some  warmth. So you could use a warm pack on your tummy   and combine it with massage and both those things  will help to stimulate your bowel motility. So now, let's just finish off with our  arms down, bring them back to your belly,   and we're going to finish off with a  couple of nice deep diaphragmatic breaths.   So we're going to breathe into the  belly, let your belly rise up again,   and then let the air fall out, fall  away. And once more, nice deep breath,   and let the air fall away. "

I consider that cheating because it doesn't support you as well. It doesn't take pressure off the ankle. You want to make sure the liner is above the plastic rim. That can really hurt your calf and cause a lot of bruising, and you want to make sure your foot fits in pretty well. Your toes should be around the edge. It doesn't have to be exact, because you're not supposed to walk on it in the first place but you have a compression sock and then a more full sock, and the beauty is that gives you a lot of padding, so you have compression, which limits swelling, and then the thicker sock gives you some cushion, and then an insole on top of that, so some of them, in the recommended notes, that's a great combo, a thick sock, compression sock, and an insole. That lets you put some weight on it getting to the bathroom and that kinda thing without much pain. And then pump it up, make sure that air bladder's in there. It keeps you from moving around. It keeps you much more stable. It keeps the axial load off your ankle. "
2329,How do i rehab my broken ankle?,11:54,13:42,714,822,1019,LZvxS101Ly4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZvxS101Ly4,"Everyone always wants to know exercises, so here it is, a massage roller stick. This is $10 or less online. Check the show notes, but you have to massage out your calf muscle, your Achilles tendon, even your plantar fascia. Studies show that doing this for 30 to 60 seconds per muscle group gives you a few hours of relaxed and flexible muscles, so even for the plantar fascia, I love to massage the plantar fascia. The idea is you're squeezing the fluid out of the ligaments, the tendons in your foot, in your calf muscle, so the ball doesn't work great anywhere except the bottom of your foot. You want to use the massage roller stick I was using on your calf and your Achilles tendon, and you can use it on your thigh too. You want loose thigh muscles, loose hamstring muscles, so there's less pressure on your calf muscle, but you could really focus time on your Achilles tendon, but you don't want to damage it. You don't want to hurt it, and lookit, for a couple hours afterwards, or a work shift afterwards, you can then stretch, so now I'm gently stretching my Achilles tendonitis. You never, and I repeat never want to cause pain. If something is torn, if something is partially torn, or if you have crippling pain while stretching, stop. That means you have to heal, you might have an injury, and you have to get that checked out with your podiatrist or foot care specialist because you could be spreading and tearing further. But lookit, before that massage and gentle stretch, I couldn't even touch my toes, but now lookit, way past my toes. You know, if I really keep doing this, sometimes I can make it all the way up to my elbow, whereas in the morning, when I get up, "

And just leave it, relax there and get it moving forward and backwards. I have people I say, just think of it like this tie. And if you're going to get your tie moving, you have to move your body first. So same thing with your arm. It's completely relaxed, and just get it moving. You can go right to left. Forward and backwards. Try to make some circles with it. And when you do that, it should feel good. - Right. - It feel like, oh, that really makes it feel better. If it hurts, it's not the thing to do. But I rarely have that hurt. "

I usually have people use theraband, or resistance band. - Or tubing. - Or tubing, right. The first one I'm going to do is start out with scapular, retraction like this. - So he's squeezing his shoulder blades together. - Exactly Bob. - Here, when he when he is actually pulling the, the theraband band back. - Right. - So. - Bob's showing you from the back, I'll show it from the side. Shoulders are going back and down. - So we're trying to stabilize the scapula here. And so then it's going to help support the, the muscles and and some of the muscles that that are involved are actually working right now too. - And I'll even have people do this without the theraband early, in early phases. - Sure. Shoulder squeezes. - Yeah. And then it'll make it stronger and start doing this. And we talk about putting your shoulder blades into your back pockets back and down, back and down. It's not this. Back and down 10 to 15 of those. - So yeah, if I'm pointing to the direction that's the direction that we're trying to make the the scapulas go or the shoulder blades. - Right. Then it's going to be 90 degrees here along the body, take a towel, fold it up and put it right here. Now, if I do this, this is the exercise, and that towel falls out, my elbow has come too far away from my body. So that's why you keep it there. It forces you to have good proper body mechanics. - The elbow was winging out. - Yep. So it's like this. This sometimes you'll find when you get out to here, oh, it starts to hurt. You feel some sharp pain, then you only shorten it up, and you do a pain free range of motion. As it improves, and you can start going out farther, then you go that. One thing I have people do is I say, well do the other side. And I'll have, them do this with the other arm. And I'll say, you want to get this arm to feel like this arm. The healthy one. Then the next one is, - That's a good comparison. Yeah. - Sure. Is internal rotation. This was out-ies we talked about, and this one's the in-ies. - Out-ies tend to be a lot more difficult. Wouldn't you say Brad? Because this is a bigger muscle that's bigger muscles that are helping you. - And a lot of times I'll skip this one because the other one is to go to go to one. So we're doing scapular retraction. We're doing the out-ies. And it's always good to do the in-ies. Same thing, if it's painful, you're not going to go through the full range. And usually it's going to be painful going out this way, as opposed to this way. Okay. Three sets at 10 on those and continue on. If you do not have theraband, - Total of 30. - Total of 30. Yep. And the first time you do it, you might just do a set of 10 and it's going to be fatigued and you had enough. So it might take a couple weeks before you build up to that three sets of 10. "

And we've had people who don't have dumbbells you simply could take a soup can. - A soup can, or later on, if they want to add weight they could actually take a a gallon of milk and, and just put it half full of water. - Right. Drink the milk first. - Drink the milk first. - Yeah. I am. - Pretty heavy. - Yeah. Whatever, some kind of container where you can vary the weight and still hold onto it. All right. - Are you going to lay down and show that? - Yep. - Oh, I got dirt on my pants, Bob. Now this would be the sore arm right here. Elbow again. It's the exact same mechanics. - You could use a towel there, I suppose. Huh? - Sure. Yep. It's not going to fall out. So right there, 90 degree bend here. And you can do this without weight. - Yep. - Early phases. This might be difficult. - Yep. - When you get way up here it might be painful. - That's the out-y . And, and we can go to the in-y then too. - Yeah. So then when you get stronger, and actually now I've got a five pound weight, but - That's a lot. - You're never going to use a five pound weight on an injury. - What you want to remember is these are small muscles. I always try to tell people this. These are small muscles working, a large lever arm. - Yeah. - You know, so they can very easily get overworked or overstrained. - Yeah. I got a healthy shoulder and I'm getting pretty tired. - You're feeling that already aren't you Brad? - Right. - Yeah. Even if you're a big weight lifter, I don't want you using huge weights on these. - Exactly. - I mean it's. - Now to do this to in-ies is a little more difficult because you don't want to lay on your shoulder and irritate it. So you have to shift a little bit. - Lay more on the, on the shoulder blade itself. - Yep. So you're going to go shift this way. - Yeah. - And then go in like this. - Yeah. - Again, this one is not so important. If you have problems with it, I wouldn't even worry about it. I would just go to the out-ies. And now for the scapular motion. - Can I make one just quick point Brad? - Yep. - You know, people think that they can do it like this. You can't. - No. - That's not working. - It has to be done laying down - You have to be laid down. - Right. - To get against gravity. - Now. The all important scapular retraction we talked about earlier about going back like that. - Right. Yeah. - When I use a theraband. You can do that nicely and this works good. And we're just going to do it laying down. - Yep. And if you, if you want to make this more difficult, you can put some weights. Oh, there we go. We can put some weights in your arms and this is pretty aggressive. - Yeah. - If I had one pound in each hand. Are you going to give me some weights Bob? - Yeah. This one alone is going to, - This is, - Well I got only five pound. You don't want that on there do you? - Oh give it to me Bob. I can take it. - Oh yeah. We'll see. - Doing those He-man. Yeah. This would be way too much. I could tell you if you have one pound in your arm, even for a big He-man, it's probably going to be adequate to strengthen those rotator cuff muscles in that manner. Okay. What about the empty can Bob? "
2339,How to strengthen the rotator cuff for throwing with a resistance band?,09:25,11:35,565,695,714,kEVThCTBmpQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEVThCTBmpQ,"- Now we're getting to the advanced stuff. - Right. If you're a thrower, whatever, whether you're a throwing a javelin or baseball, you're going to need theraband for this. There's no other way around it. As far as I'm concerned. And what we're going to do, if this is my throwing arm, the first thing we're going to do is we were doing this facing this way. The resistance is at we're going to turn 90 degrees. And at the same time, 45 degrees on this arm, turned 90 degrees like this, the elbow. Bob, can you put your finger right there by the electro non? That point is not going to move. Everything rotates like that. - Yep. - I'm going to do 10 of those. And then I'm going to do the Codmans, let it rest a little bit. Then I'm going to do 10 more. This is hard. - Sure. - I'm kind of getting tired already at the healthy arm. And then rest it and do three sets of 10. Then when that goes good, you're going to advance it from 45 degrees to 90, because that's the throwing motion. - Originally again. So just to, so we're clear here, Brad. - Yep. - Here's a 90 right degree angle. - Yeah. - The first time he was halfway in between - Right. - Upright and right, right in here. - Right. That was the first one he was doing. Now he's up here. - Exactly. Good point. So now I'm up here. I'm going to keep - The same thing. - That's still. And we're going to do three sets of 10 of that. Again, we're going to need rest time in between - Yeah very aggressive. - Yep. - Now you gotta think about this. We're not throwing this way. We're throwing this way. So going this way is important. So we start out down here at 45. - So 45. Yep. - And then when that feels comfortable three sets of 10. Then the 90 degree. - All these need to be pain free. - Right. Exactly. Good point Bob. - Don't be progressing these if you're, if you're if it's still painful. - Right. - You go back to the step before you. - Exactly. Yeah. And for you throwers, this has to be pain free. And you're probably going to work on a lot of external rotation going back like this exact same throwing motion. - In the full range. motion. - Yeah. And those throwers, I think they're pretty experienced. If you're a young thrower, take your time with this. Don't worry about trying to, you know, throw a hundred mile ball by really working it because it could hurt your shoulder. "

You're going to take your thumbs and place them at the back of the head, or the base of the skull. If you feel off to the side you should feel two large bumps (off to the side of your head). That's the spot where you're going to want to put the thumbs at. I'm going to find those two spots right there, take my thumbs place them at the base of the skull and then lock my knuckles. The next part is going to be the traction. We're going to lift up on those two spots, so just like this. Then I'm going to lift up until I feel a very good stretch right in the neck. You can also tilt the chin towards the chest to get a little bit of a better angle on it while you lift up and create that traction.The goal is to hold it for about a half minute (thirty seconds), relax, and then repeat it three to five times. You can do this stretch as needed throughout the day, as long as you're finding relief with it. "

So another way to be able to do this stretch is just using a normal hand towel, and I like to fold it up just like that. You're going to place this again at the base of the skull, right at those two spots where you feel those bumps. You're going to grab the ends of the towel with your hands right here and then start to lift up to get that traction. Again, with this one I like to hold it for about 30 seconds, relax, and then do it upwards to three to five times. A lot of times with disc bulges in the neck you're going to get a one-sided arm pain. That's generally from the spot where that bulge is going off towards. So what you can do with this stretch is modify it to the point where you're going to get a lot of relief from a bulging disc that's causing it to go down into the arm or hands. So to do that, pull up on it and then on one side just pull a little bit more. Almost kind of like a side tilt with your head, and you can do this to the point where it starts to help relieve that bulge and gives that pain relief. Give it a try, see if it works for you. "

All right, let's get to the exercises, Bob. - All right. - Bob, can you hold this? - Sure. You want me to do the exercise or no? - No, I've already had it in my mind, - Okay. - I pictured myself doing 'em. I wanna do the figure four first, which is pretty simple. You just take your right ankle, put it on your left knee. It's gonna look like this from this angle. And you can do this on bed. - So you're making the four here? - Right. Yep. And if you wanna stretch your hip a little bit here, you can. But the primary part of the stretch is you're gonna bring this knee up, okay? And you feel that stretch right down in there, okay? Now the nice thing about this exercise, you can do it in two different ways. I would start here, see what the results are. And you're gonna feel these results pretty quick, it should feel good while you're doing it. - Yeah, if it makes it worse or it spreads the pain out? - Yeah. - It's done. - It's done. - Check it off. It's not for you. You can also do it in a seated position. Make sure you have good posture here and you push here. This is gonna vary. I would start there, you can try it this way and see how it results, okay? Again, you should feel the symptom relief while you're doing it and very quickly, and it should feel good after you're done. You get up, you walk around, you should have positive results, feeling better. If not, check it off. - Just as verification here, Brad. So, if the pain's going down the right leg that's the one you cross over? - Right. - So you wanna lay down one real quick? - Sure. - So, if it's right leg, you're gonna go like that. - Right. - If it's left leg, you're gonna go like that. - Good point, Bob. - And then you're gonna pull up. Then you're pulling up like that, yeah? - Yes. - Okay. - Yep. Excellent point, Bob. - All right. - This is why he's along, 'cause otherwise I miss - - once in a while - - major points like this. - I come in handy. "

Now you can't do this one on the bed, you really should do it on a carpeted floor so it's comfortable. Hands here and a simple press up like this, and down. - Now what he's doing here is he's keeping his pelvis down. He's not lifting this up like a board, right? He's trying to make an arch in the back here. That's really key. And again, if it starts to hurt when you go way up, just go into the pain-free zone. - Yep. - Stay down in the lower end here. - Now on this one, if you're having pain down your leg, but the first one, it might be uncomfortable, you do a few more, and if it starts to improve with each repetition, you keep going. 10 is usually the max you do at one time. You can maybe go up to 15 if you're getting really positive results or feeling really good. - And by positive, what he means is that quite often if the pain's going all the way down the leg, it might start coming up the leg a little bit. It won't go as far. - Right. - With all these issues, the further the pain spreads out the worse it's getting. - Right. - If your pain is right up in here in the back, if you can get it back up into the back and staying there, even if it's a little worse, that's better than leg pain going down. - Right. - Or numbness or tingling going down. - If you're starting this and you have no symptoms or pain down your leg, then you're gonna look at the back pain and the back pain should feel better or feel like it's going into a smaller spot. - Shrinking up, yeah.

This one, you're gonna lay down, legs flat. Again, the figure four, but in a flat position. - [Bob] Sure. - Just like that. Then begin. Right leg is gonna be the one with the symptoms of pain. - [Bob] Okay. - And you can do a little hip stretch here and see how that goes. But the primary part is you get a tennis ball and you're gonna put it, now where you put it, you're gonna have to figure out. I mean, I know where the piriformis muscle is and I can get to it pretty quickly. But if you're not familiar with the anatomy that well, you're gonna have to find. Usually, on this it's gonna hurt a little bit. - [Bob] Right. Little bit of a tender spot. - Right. But you're just gonna leave it on there for about, after 30 seconds or so the pain should decrease notably and you say, oh, I feel quite a bit better. And then if that symptom's gone away, go along with it and they go away. You know, your goal, you wanna keep looking at. - This is actually an interesting technique, Brad. I never seen this one before. I actually will have to try this with some of my patients. - Sure. Yeah. - I can see how it would work. - Yeah. And you can move that tennis ball from site to site. You might try it four or five different locations and just monitor it. Again, 30 seconds or so roughly, and you should start to feel positive results. And when you get done and you get up and walk around again, if you're pain's outta five or down to your knee or your ankle, if it's up to your buttock area and it's abolished that leg pain, you know your goal, to continue to do that - - Right. - At least three times a day. - At least. You could do it even more. - Yep. - I mean, and again, we emphasize again, this should make things better. - You're right. - If it makes things worse, you stop immediately. - Yep. Yep. - This is not... - You just scratch it off. "

Where it's processed, and then you pee it out basically. - Right, exactly. - So you got to have it, so that basically is trying to encourage the fluid to go this way. - Right.

Hi I'm Captain Joe Bruni.  What we are going to talk about is how to access the airway, breathing and circulation in the unconscious or conscious victim.  We approach the victim and make sure that the scene is safe.  First and foremost, and kneel next to the patient if they are lying in this position.  The very next thing we will do is long as we don't suspect a neck or cervical spine injury is to tilt the head back and using the chin lift technique to open the airway.  We will then go down and look, listen and feel, looking for chest rise, feeling against our cheek for the exchange of air or breathing and listening for the exchange of air.  If there is no exchange of air, rescue breathes may be in order.  After the airways assessed, to assess circulation we place two fingers  along side the neck feeling for the carotid artery to determine if a person has circulation or pulse.  If we are determining circulation on an infant we would check the area between the elbow and the arm pit known as the brachial artery, again using two fingers.  Do not use the thumb to assess circulation as the thumb has it's own pulse center.  Two fingers is the way to check circulation.  So again, abc's of airway, breathing and circulation are head tilt, chin lift, look, listen and feel  and then feel for the carotid pulse to determine if there's circulation.

You do a manual muscle test to yourself. It's not that hard. The first thing you can do, let's say this is my right leg. This is where I have the symptoms, and I'm going to kick out like this and down and you're gonna compare one leg to the other. Now, if you have difficulty-- - [Bob] Even straightening. - Straightening it, that's a pretty severe case. You probably wanna see a doctor. - [Bob] Yeah, and not only that, there's a slight chance you coulda tore the muscle too. - Sure. - You could have trouble with it too. - Right, yeah, so maybe a crossover of symptoms. So the next thing to do is a single leg sit to stand test. You need a firm chair with armrests, and what you gotta do is test your good leg first. So I'm gonna bring this leg up, and I'm gonna stand up with this leg only. You may need, you know, unless you're really strong. You may need and likely need to push up from here. Now I can do pretty easy with both arms, and I'm gonna take one off and I can go like that. And then okay, I'm gonna go just to a finger tip, and ooh, that's about it for me. - Sure. - Okay. Now the other leg, if I need both hands to push up, and I go to one hand and it's not going up, it's pretty clear you got a weakness. - Sure. - So you probably have the femoral nerve. - Involvement. - Pinched, yup.

If that's the case, just work on small micro press-ups here or mini press-ups and work your way up further and further, again, keeping the pelvis on the floor. Now this does two things. One, you're working on the back if it's a disc problem, but it's also working on the hip flexors. - Right. - And stretching them out too. So you're getting kinda two for one here. - And you're still getting some of that superficial muscles in the abdominal for that cutaneous. - Right, right, yeah, yeah. - You're stretching that too. - There's really nothing go wrong with this. If you happen to have spondylolisthesis or a stenosis, this one is probably not gonna be for you. - Yeah, and you're gonna wanna do these actually not just once a day, you could do these throughout the day. - Exactly. - You could do it four to six times, spread out throughout the day and do like repetitions of 10. - Yep. - And see again how it responds.

I might even offer a little, little stretch gently, very gently, stretching that as long as it feels clearly better. The thing about this is you may wanna do it on your good leg first and see how it feels and then do your involved leg. - That's a good idea. - And compare the good to the bad and it's gonna give you a good indication on if it's improving or not. - To tell you right away how tight that one is. - Yup. - It might feel tighter or it might look tighter.

I think it's easier. - I knew I always get it wrong. - It's just easier for the viewers to see. There we go, yup. - All right, so I'm gonna stretch. I'm stretching to hip flexor here. So I'm keeping very good posture. I can actually even use my hand and push forward a little bit here like this and really stretch her out. - So we're really stretching the same muscle groups and structures, but it's a different angle. And sometimes it helps. - Yeah, and I usually definitely put a pillow down at my age because it's a little rough on the floor. Can you try facing the camera? I wanna show him my one little trick that can just accelerate or modify the stretch. Now for this, you gotta have a balance. You might wanna hold on to this just for balance. - Sure. - Okay, actually with the other arm because so you do your stretch forward. Now take this hand and do this. There, that's his balancing, so he's gonna lean this way and you feel a little bit more of a stretch. - Yeah, yeah, you do actually. Yeah, and they say that you get a little flossing with that nerve. - Oh, sure. - With that as well.

2382,How to properly count a patient's respiratory rate?,02:16,05:18,136,318,333,IDFaPKFbIO8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFaPKFbIO8,looking for is the rise and the fall of the chest one rise and one fall of the chest equals one breath but this is where the tricky part comes into play because it's like how do I determine what's a rise and what's a fall of the chest so I can count one breath and here are some tips to help you do that now with these tips you're going to find in practice that some of these tips work great on some patients while others you may have to change it up a bit because every patient is built differently they're gonna be wearing different clothes like some patients are wearing downs I may not even have a gown on and some may be wearing their regular street clothes and a lot of patients they have different disease processes going on so one thing I like to do if I know this patient it's gonna be hard to count their respiratory rate I'm gonna get down at the level of their chest like their shoulder and chest area and their abdominal level because I'm looking at that rise and that fall of that chest I'm getting down here looking at that while I'm checking that pulse rate so I start out in that position and some patients it's really easy to tell depending on how they breathe like the shoulder area will move up and down the chest area will move back and forth or the abdominal area will go up and down now if your patient has like a severe disease process where the respiratory system is being affected like with congestive heart failure a lot of fluid volume overload they have trouble breathing so they're going to use these abdominal muscles to help pull in and out that air you can actually just see that I've been going in and out so that's really helpful whenever you're trying to figure out the rate another tip you could do but I would use this with discretion depending on your patient and how they are would be whenever you go to feel that pulse rate you can lightly put your hand on their back on their chest or whatever so you can feel the rise and the fall of the chest but with some patients like if they're agitated confused or they're just someone who he doesn't want you in their personal space you wouldn't want to use this but with some patience you can and my last tip would be to group it with your physical assessment so whenever you're going to assess the chest you're gonna listen to heart sounds and lung sounds what you want to do is tell the patient I'm gonna listen to your heart sounds for one full minute so while you're there listening to both heart sounds and then lung sounds they're not gonna think that something's wrong so you're going to take your stethoscope and first you can listen to their breath sounds and count that rate it's best to try to pick an area that you want to count that rate where there's no a lot of adipose tissue because I can really muffle those breath sounds so generally at that second to fourth intercostal space anteriorly about mid clavicular that could be a great place to count those breath sounds but again it really depends on how your patient is built then after you count that rate then you can proceed and listen to their heart sounds okay so

2384,How to treat a winged scapula with a levator scapulae stretch?,02:32,04:27,152,267,835,0x67u3QLQnQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x67u3QLQnQ,"three times. so then the next one is going to be the levator scapulae stretch, or levator scapulae, and so what that does is that elevates the levator, elevates that shoulder blade. and a lot of times that one has a lot to do with the shoulder blade not functioning properly. so you really want to get a stretch out. you want to make sure those muscle fibers are where they're supposed to be, and they're not knotted up causing some instability or some imbalances in those muscles. so the way to stretch your levator scapulae muscle is if I'm stretching my right side, I'm going to take my right hand and I'm just gonna place it kind of up. and my hand's gonna be back on my shoulder blade, and my elbow is gonna be up towards the ceiling. now some people can't do this. this might be a little uncomfortable. you don't have to do this, this just helps push that scapula down to give you a better stretch. some people just raise their arm, which is fine. you can do that as well. I just like to do it this way, but again if this is too uncomfortable for your shoulder, then you don't have to do this. this is just gonna give you that extra stretch. then you're gonna take your other hand and place it behind your head. so it's not on the side but it's actually behind your head, and then you're gonna pull your head down at an angle towards your knees. so this one's a little bit tough for people sometimes, but you want to imagine you're taking your nose down towards your opposite knee. so it's at an angle. it's not to the side, it's not down in front of you, but it's at that angle. so bringing this up, hand behind the head, pulling down, getting that stretch, and you should feel it right through there. that levator goes all the way up into the neck at that c-spine and then attaches down to that shoulder blade, so it has a lot to do. so again, thirty seconds holding that stretch, do it three times. I always recommend, especially in the neck area, to stretch both sides. if you don't have time, that's okay, just do one side, but I would definitely do both sides. so then the next one is going to be a lat "
2385,How to treat a winged scapula with a lats stretch?,04:27,05:53,267,353,835,0x67u3QLQnQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x67u3QLQnQ,"I would definitely do both sides. so then the next one is going to be a lat stretch. and yes the lats are attached to your scapula, it's just a little piece at the bottom down at the apex, but it is attached, and it really makes a difference in the function of that shoulder blade. so a pretty good stretch for the lat is, kind of coming down into a prayer stretch or a Child's Pose. this is one that I really like to get this stretch. and you can kind of stretch in an angle if you really want to get one specific side. so now that you're facing this way if I wanted to stretch my left side I'm going to kind of get into that child's pose position. if this is too tough on your knees, you can actually start up in this position and put your hands out first, and come back. so you don't have to go all the way down to your bottom, but I kind of like being on my knees. but again, if this is not comfortable for you don't do it. you don't have to do it on the floor, you can do it on your bed or on a couch, but when you come down, you're gonna come down slightly at an angle to get that lat stretch side. so instead of just coming down into a regular child's pose or prayer stretch, but you can, I'm gonna come over at an angle. and I should be feeling that stretch all along through there. so kind of getting that stretch. if you have something that you can grab on to like if you're on a table or something, you can grab the edge of like a therapy table, and get that stretch. so again 30 seconds. if you have time to do both, you want to do three on each side. so then the next one is going to be a subscapularis stretch. and this "
2386,How to treat a winged scapula with a subscapular stretch?,05:54,07:23,354,443,835,0x67u3QLQnQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x67u3QLQnQ,"each side. so then the next one is going to be a subscapularis stretch. and this is part of your rotator cuff muscles. this is the one that sits underneath. so again it's kind of there where that rib cage is, and so a pretty neat way to stretch it is you can either use a cane. you can use a PVC pipe. you can use a broomstick. you can even you do this against a doorway, but sometimes this one works a little bit better because you can get an extra stretch in there. so what you want to do is you want to take the stick, or the PVC pipe, and you're going to kind of place your elbow under on this side. so I actually want to put it behind my elbow where I don't see it. then I'm just going to grab kind of here on the top of the pipe or something. so you see it's a little bit of an awkward position, but you do want to get that little bit of bend in your wrist too. and then all you're gonna do is turn it back this way. now again this is going to be pretty uncomfortable, especially if you have some issues going on, so it might be a little bit too much. some people kind of roll their hand and do it ,and then pull back. so you can do that way as well if you don't have the stick or the pipe. but it's that rotation going backwards to get that stretch. so since this one might be a little bit uncomfortable, you can start with twenty to thirty seconds, but you still want to get in that twenty to thirty second hold for that stretch to get a full stretch doing three times. and again, this one goes a little bit into the shoulder, so you don't have to do both sides, but I would just to keep everything nice and balanced. so then the next one is going "

2388,How to treat a winged scapula with an serratus anterior muscle exercise?,09:07,10:28,547,628,835,0x67u3QLQnQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x67u3QLQnQ,"coming away from that rib cage. so a really easy, really efficient way to start working the serratus anterior muscle is you're gonna kind of, first you can start off at just a 90 degree with your hands out in front of you. if you're, if you've never done this before, this one's a little bit tough because you really have to keep your elbows locked out. sometimes people think because it's a punch you're punching, but you're really moving the whole shoulder complex. I like to do them together you don't have to, you can do one at a time, but I'm not punching my hands I'm moving the whole shoulder complex forward. so ideally to really get in that good scapular plane, instead of just doing the 90 which you can start off doing, you want to really bring your arms up to about a hundred and twenty to a hundred and forty degree angle. so you're really almost like you're punching up towards the corner in the ceiling. so I'm bringing everything up, and I'm coming back down. and if you can see here, I'm moving everything for that's a protraction motion, and that's what that serratus anterior does. so just punch forward and slowly come back. if you've never done this before you, might just want to start with five or ten a couple sets, several times a day. you can work your way up to 20-25, and if that's easy, then you can go on to the next ones. so then the next one is going to be kind of "
2389,How to treat a winged scapula with a push up plus exercise?,10:28,11:36,628,696,835,0x67u3QLQnQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x67u3QLQnQ,"then you can go on to the next ones. so then the next one is going to be kind of what I call a modified push up plus. if you know what a push up plus is ,you're actually in the push up position. sometimes again that's a little too hard for people to start off with, so I like to do it kind of more in a Quadraped push up Plus. and so basically what it is is once you get into that push-up position, or that quadruped position, then you're plussing you're going up even further. so I like to kind of start down in that prayer stretch or that Child's Pose, that's the motion you want to kind of start off in here. and then you're going to come up kind of almost that push in a Quadraped, and then do a plus. almost like a cat, the cat stretch, but you're doing it in a fluid motion. you're not stretching as you go. so then you're coming back down going to that stretch, pushing up, push up, and then push up into that plus, and then come back down. and so I'm kind of doing it in pieces so you can see it, but you really want to do it in a fluid motion. that's the best way to get it done. so again, if you haven't worked on these muscles before just start off with five or ten, couple sets, and then do this a couple times a day. so "

I really like resistive bands because it gets both motions with resistance. if you're just doing weights, you can, but then you're not getting that kind of eccentric work coming back. so the next one is a bear hug. and so it's kind of just like it sounds. you're gonna put the band around you, and again you can do these in standing or sitting in a chair, you don't have to do them on the floor. but you want to do just like what a bear hug sounds like. you're gonna come out and around like you're going in to give somebody a hug, and then come back out in. so it's not out and then straight back, you have to come back out or you're gonna bump into the person you're hugging. so really come out, push forward, and then come back in and squeeze those shoulder blades in. so out, push forward, squeeze those shoulder blades in. so again start off with the lightest resistance band depending on what brand it is it might be a different color, usually with the thera-band brand it starts off with yellow and then red it's the next one. I'd always start off with the lightest one even if it feels easy. just wait and see how your body reacts the next day. and then so the last one is "

Let's start off on our back in bed just like this. Our legs are going to be off, knees bent roughly at ninety degrees. Feet are going to be flat during this exercise. That way, we can push and pull and slide our body off the edge of this bed. Arms go straight at the elbow. Hands are going to grip at the edge. What I'm going to do from here is slowly start or slowly slide my body off the edge of that bed. To the point where my hips and my buttock are off the edge of that bed and gravity is starting to take my lower body weight down towards the floor. Let's reposition the knees at 90° like this. Feet are also again going to be flat. When you do this, it's going to put the back into extension which helps take pressure off spinal discs. It should feel like a very deep stretch at the very low end of the lumbar spine. This should be targeting L5. From here, let's hold this position comfortably for thirty seconds. Do nice, slow, controlled breathing also. Just let the tension out. The more you relax, the better this treatment will be. From here, what we're going to do is slowly just inch down a little bit more and try to target the next segment above which would be L4. The great part about this exercise, we're going to target L5 all the way through L1. All of the segments of the lower back. Again, just repeat this. We're going to reposition our legs so this is comfortable, we're going to let gravity take it down towards the floor and just hold this position for 30 seconds and then just repeat all the way up to the top of the lower back. When you do this, you're going to notice that one certain spot hits it just a little bit better, gives you more relief. Maybe it's right here for me. Make note of that, that's the spot that you're going to want to concentrate on and throw more repetitions in, I would recommend doing this three to five times and just kind of relaxing after about 30 seconds and then repeating. If this becomes too easy, you can take it to the next level by raising your body up and taking one arm and sliding it underneath the back right at the edge of the bed. This will put the back into more extension and at that point, intensifying the stretch, you can also use a rolled-up towel or even a pillow underneath your back. So, experiment with that. If you get more relief, use it but you can also take this one to the next next level by incorporating a lateral lean into it to take more pressure off the back. So, let's go back to that spot that's offering us the most amount of relief. Let's say it's right here for me. What I'm going to do is cross my arms over my shoulders like this. I always call it the mummy and then from there, I'm going to take one shoulder and try to just go towards one edge of the bed, keeping my back flat during this whole exercise. When you do this, you're going to feel the back start open up just a little bit differently so experiment with this go all the way towards the left or until a point where you feel relief hold that for about 30 seconds relax and then you can repeat this you can also try it on the other side but go through all of the motions target the spots that need it the most and throw more "

To start off with, let's go on all fours in bed just like this. I like to have my feet off to the side of the bed or at the edge of the bed I should say and I hook at the edge with my feet for a stable anchor point. From here, let's start off by doing the child's pose. I'm going to tuck my chin towards my chest like this, pull my arms out in front of me. From there, I'm just going to lower my butt down towards the heels as much as I can while I keep my arms straight and just really grip into the bed with your fingers. Once we have a very comfortable stretch, let's try to inch forward with our fingers just a little bit to intensify the stretch. The key is to allow the upper body, chest to sag down towards the bed. It will help really stretch in between the shoulder blades but with this, you should feel a full back stretch from the shoulders all the way down to the tailbone. Hold this comfortably for thirty seconds. Do nice, slow, controlled breathing also. Let that tension out. From there, we're going to go "

So, we just rock forward like this to the point where our hips and our pelvis go flat. During this exercise, we want to make sure to have our hips and pelvis flat. We're not arching up like this. We're putting the lower back into extension which will help decompress those spinal discs. If this position right here is too much, you can do what is known as a half cobra. So, instead of straightening the arms, we just go on to the elbows just like this. So, experiment with them, go with whatever you feel is the comfortable but you want to hold this position for twenty to 30 seconds again do nice slow controlled breathing from there we're just gonna go back into the child's pose and with the next repetition always challenge yourself also to stretch down a little bit further to intensify this stretch but you want to just repeat this nice and slow for about three to five complete repetitions. If you want to take this one to the next level, what you can do is instead of going straight out with it, let's angle a body just very slightly towards one direction. I'll go a little bit towards my right and then repeat. What you'll notice is is that this hits the back just a little bit differently. So, go all the way towards the right and then go all the way towards the left. If you notice that one certain angle hits it a little bit better, make note of that. Throw more repetitions in and you can also repeat this while doing the cobra. So, give that a try and focus on the spots that you feel just need a little bit more chin. So, here is a great three-part exercise "

First part is very easy. What I'm going to do is slowly slide forward until my shoulders and my head are completely off the edge of that bed. From there, just allow gravity to take them both. When you do this, you're already going to feel a very good stretch happening into the lower back that works it's way up to the upper back try to hold this for about 30 seconds do nice slow control breathing again the more you relax the better this exercise will be but if you want from here you can hold this for a longer period of time if it feels good hold it for several minutes grab a book, an iPhone, anything just take your mind off it and let gravity do all of the work if you need a breather just slide back just like this and take one but you want to try to do this for about three repetitions and you can slide forward just a little bit more with each repetition also because that's only going to intensify the stretch because gravity is taking more body weight, increasing that traction throughout the whole back. In the second part, let's take this one to the next level. What I'm going to do is keep going forward off the edge of the bed until I can go on my elbows just like this. I want my body weight to be supported on my forearms and my elbows. My elbows go slightly pointed out from my body. I just interlock my hands just like this for a very stable anchor point. Let's tuck the chin towards the chest very slightly. From here, this should be a very, very good stretch pretty much into the lower back all the way up to the upper back. We want to hold this position for about thirty seconds. Do nice, slow controlled breathing again. When you need a breather, you can just push yourself back up but you want to do this one for about three to five complete repetitions. And if it feels good, you can hold it for an extended period of time. In the third part, we can really make this a lot stronger by incorporating more of a child's pose position into this. So, instead of going up on our elbows, what I'm going to do is straighten my arms out, just like this, take my fingers, grip into the floor of the carpet, and from here, tuck the chin towards the chest and then crawl forward with the arms as much as you can. The more that you crawl forward with the arms, the more that you're going to feel it throughout the back. Also let the chest try to sag down towards the floor because that will also help stretch the upper back even more but once we feel a very good traction throughout the whole back let's hold this position for 30 seconds again if you need a breather just push yourself back up with your arms pull with your legs but you want to do this for three to five complete repetitions to take this one even to the next level I don't know how many times I've said that so far what I'm going to do is turn my body and angle it towards one certain direction. So, in this case, I'm going all the way towards my right. When you do this, you're going to feel the muscles and the back it hit just a little bit differently. So, experiment with going all the way towards the right, go all the way towards the left. If you notice that one certain spot like right here on this right side for me, hits it just the best. What I'm going to do at that point is throw more repetitions in because I'm targeting areas that's releasing pressure and also offering relief. If the video "

A foot sprain is damage to the ligaments that occurs in the arch, arch underneath area of the foot. To properly treat that area, have the patient lie down and elevate the foot to at least the chest height, or slightly higher to reduce blood flow. Apply some type of cold, commercial ice pack or ice itself, to the injured area to reduce pain and swelling. If using ice or a cold pack, you may want to use some type of cloth material so that ice pack or that ice itself is not up against the skin which could cause a cold burn injury. After ten to fifteen minutes, remove the ice and wrap the area with some type of pressured bandage to help support the foot and to reduce the pain and discomfort. The pressure bandage may have to be worn for several days as the person nurses them self back to health and they try to walk on the foot, as the pressure bandage will provide support to the arch area of the foot. Strains and sprains can be a pretty painful experience, but with proper treatment, things can go quite well. After forty-eight hours, apply heat to the area to increase blood flow and dilate the blood vessels which will promote a faster healing time. I'm Captain Joe Bruni. Stay safe and "

Here you are 50 some years old, but look how far back Brad can go. - And this would be normal if you could. - Yeah. You should really be able to go back. I don't care if you're in your seventies or eighties and you're only gonna go this far. We can improve on it. You can go further. - Right.

Now, if you look at me and if you're fairly observant, you're gonna see that I am stiff going to the right. I go a lot further to the left than I go to the right. Am I correct, Brad? - You are correct. He's correct. - You concur. So that is the direction, quite often when I do start getting pain, that's what direction I work on. And it definitely takes away my pain. So I'm not lying. - You should do it some more. Maybe you could regain that permanently. "

It's only gonna take a few seconds out of your hour. - Sure. - But we want you doing it a lot of times throughout the day, five to six, seven times a day. So take a few seconds, work on it. Forget about it. Go back an hour later, work on it again for a few seconds. - Right. So you're gonna go through these exercises we're gonna show you, to improve that range of motion that you know you've lost or you wanna regain. - And it improves the range of motion, it decreases the pain. - Right. - Let's start off with the first one. Brad extension. I'll do mine first. - Yep. - If that's right. - Sure. So I like to use a towel with salvage on the end and that's a kind of a fitted end. - Yep. - I don't know if it's a sewing term or what it is, but... - Yeah, we don't know but one way or another... - Sounds English, to me. - Edge of the towel. - So I got the edge of the towel and I'm grabbing with my hands and you can see I'm at a little bit of an angle here. That's because the joints angle this way. And so it's actually gonna facilitate me moving back like this. Now, once I have it in this direction, and I like to be in a chair like Brad, I'm just showing here right now without the chair, because Brad's in a chair. - Yeah. (Brad laughs) - And I'm gonna go ahead. I'm not just gonna go like this. I'm actually gonna go up with it. My eyes are following my thumbs. And now if that hurts, what I would try doing, is moving the level of the salvage down onto a different level of the neck, to a different vertebrae and then try it again. And you're gonna find one of 'em tends to work better than the other. - Right. I mean, you can usually get three or four levels. So I usually just kind of zigzag the towel back and forth and go down a little bit. And it catches into the skin. You don't wanna do it over your clothing. Right directly on this skin and I'm pulling and going back and I'll actually lean into the back of the chair sometimes as well. - Yep. Absolutely, I lean back into the chair. Find the one that doesn't hurt. Go ahead and do six to eight, 10 reps and then you're done. - Right. - And then you can do it again later in the day. - Right. - And do it throughout today and you're gonna find out your pain levels eventually go down. - Right, so yeah, it's only gonna take you less than a minute. - Yeah. - 30 seconds to go ahead and do it. - Yep, so then we're gonna go and show the Brad method here. - Right, so this one I've done this with a lot of people. I'll do Bob's method too, but sometimes if the person doesn't have good shoulder motion and that's hard for 'em or sometimes this will work just fine right off the bat. It's a little easier to instruct to someone as I'll just have them roll up the towel in a bundle like this, get it low on the neck back on the chair, shoulders back, and just have them let's say without the towel you get to hear it kind of hurts and then with the towel with the support snugly tension here, there you go. And they'll say, ""Oh boy, that feels a lot better."" - It does feel good, and I use your method quite often, Brad. - So you could use Bob's or mine. You can comment which one you like better but that'll work well. And the same thing for frequency. Five, maybe 10 repetitions at the most. But repeat that throughout the day as you regain more motion with less pain. - The thing is you want to go further, further, further. Remember McKenzie? I don't remember what you say. - The end range is where the magic happens. - Yep. Yep. ""Further, further, further, further,"" they'd always say the instructor. "

Now we're gonna go into rotations and the same thing with this, I'd rather do it in a chair but Brad's gonna show it in the chair. I'm doing it with salvage again, right underneath the ears. I'm at the angle again. And what you're gonna do, I'm gonna work on rotation to the left, so I drop this one down on the left side. I grab the one on the right side. I pull down, I pull this one out. This one's not going across like this because you won't be able to breathe. And then you're gonna go ahead and pull it around like this as you're rotating. And that's gonna help facilitate that motion. Now again, you can try different levels with that. Brad, do you wanna show how you keeping the shoulder back? - Oh yeah. So if I'm doing this one, see how my right shoulders... - Yeah, is moving. He wants to keep it back here. Sometimes people kinda lock their arm on the chair. - Yeah. - Brad, you were just mentioning earlier that you'd actually hold your patients like this just to give them a feel of how it should feel without allowing the shoulder to go along with it. - I tell them to imagine there's big claws holding your shoulders still and you can't move them. Sometimes people have that imaginary thing. - Yeah. That helps, the little visualization. - Not monster claws, nice claws. - By the way, do you know what Brad? I don't if you were ever taught this, I was taught that if you're lacking motion in both directions you should be concerned that you might have ankylosing spondylitis. - Oh really? - Yeah. - Don't get too concerned. - Just don't get concerned. I was just throwing that out there. "

Now side bending, you can do the same as extension, you can use a towel, and use the salvage if you want. Or you can do a Brad's method but you wanna be in really good position. Actually, a lot of times, Brad, do you wanna show 'em? A lot of times I actually do a chin tuck even before I do a side bend. - So first of all, it's good posture. I have a gentle chin tuck. Not really far in. - He's not going down. He's not going up. He's just going back. But that really puts you in right position. - Right, and then... - Side bend. Yep. And as you were mentioning, Brad, don't be doing this. Don't turn to your head and go like this. - Right. - You want to actually put that ear on your shoulder. - Right, while maintaining that in line. - Yeah, I often will try towards the painful side first. If you're having pain on this side, I'll work on that side. You can take your fingertips and actually give a little bit of stretch. Don't be grabbing with your whole big mit there and grabbing your skull and pulling it over. (Brad laughs) - It's a gentle. - Yeah. Gentle stretch. "
2495,How to strengthen the rotator cuff with the full can exercise?,01:55,03:51,115,231,594,-NA8lUy5_Qc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NA8lUy5_Qc,the first exercise is something called the full cam which is going to target the supraspinatus muscle of the rotator cuff this exercise is likely your best bet for strengthening this muscle since as shown in 2007 EMG analysis when compared to other rotator cuff exercises the full can elicits a high amount of EMG activity of the supraspinatus with the least amount of deltoid activity which is beneficial as this has been shown to reduce shear force placed on the shoulder joint and better help strengthen the rotator cuff without having the deltoid compensate by overpowering it but in order to maximize the effectiveness of this exercise it's crucial that you perform the full can exercise correctly start with your arms by your sides with a set of light weights in each hand keep your arms straight and raise them up in the scapular plane as shown here which is both 30 degrees from directly sideways point your thumbs up towards the ceiling and raise your arms up until you reach around shoulder height since research has shown that this is the range of motion where the supraspinatus is most active pause at the top position for a second or two before lowering down and as you perform the movement you want to keep your shoulder blades pinned together and pulled down as research indicates that this both increases joint space and allows you to strengthen the supraspinatus in a more mechanical advantageous position in addition as you raise avoid shrugging your shoulders up and instead keep them down with your upper traps remaining as relaxed as possible throughout each rep implementing the aforementioned tips will help you best strengthen the supraspinatus while minimizing any compensations from other stronger muscle groups i'd suggest starting out with lighter weight for two to three sets of 15 to 20 reps with a focus on form and then over time continue progressing from there 
2496,How to strengthen the rotator cuff with the side lying external rotation exercise?,03:51,05:48,231,348,594,-NA8lUy5_Qc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NA8lUy5_Qc,there the next exercise sideline external rotation is going to be used to target the to posterior rotator cuff muscles at once the infraspinatus and the teres minor and this exercise is your best bet at doing so since as shown in the following - William G grass from a 2004 analysis of the rotator cuff muscles this exercise elicits the highest and first peñitas and Terry's minor activation when compared to several other rotator cuff exercises in addition to having the lowest strain on the shoulder joint as well but again to reap the full benefits of this exercise is vital that you performing correctly to start assume a sideline position with a towel roll pinned between your top sidearm and ribcage the towel is a really important step since research has shown that adding a towel role to the exercise boosts EMG activation of the - posterior OT - cuff muscles by roughly 20% as it helps minimize any movement compensation from occurring next pull your shoulder blades back and down and keep them this way as you start doing reps start with your arm parallel to the floor and then while keeping your elbow pinned to your side slowly externally rotate outwards by pulling your hand up towards the ceiling and then return back down to parallel and repeat you want to focus on avoiding letting the elbow drift up off your side as you raise the weight as this will start involving more of the deltoids instead keep the elbow locked in place against the towel at your side as you perform your DREV but if you struggle to do so or you feel pain at the very top position then you can start with partial reps in a pain free zone and then progressively increase the range of motion from there over time I'd suggest starting out with a lighter weight or even no way that first for two to three sets of 15 to 20 reps each side and then progressing from there as you get stronger

So once, you know, someone's had a stroke they're at home or in the clinic, one of the first things I do is, you know, get 'em up on their feet and see if that leg, here we got the tape here, Is that leg gonna accept weight, or is it gonna buckle? Obviously, if it's gonna buckle, we're gonna work on strengthening exercises. In this situation, the person can bear weight and fairly stable on it. So if they, you know, get 'em to have a walker, I think we can see that leg in there, and I'll have the person stand, check without hand-hold, make sure they're safe, hands back on, and then I'll go weight shift. So can they put all the weight to the right leg without having this happen? Okay. So, and if that looks good, well, then we progress to the next step. We can go to some marching and can the person go up like this and like this. And not only looking to see if the knee flexes, but does the knee hyperextend like that. Because that's a real common quadriceps weakness that happens with a stroke leg. Okay. So we're gonna look at that and assess that. If they have good enough stability with the marching then we're gonna go right into walking. Okay. And what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna show you some gait problems that are pretty common. - Some walking problems that are common. - So here we got the tape, that's the weak leg. A lot of times the toe will drag, we have foot drops. The toe is unable to lift up and dorsiflex so you have clearance and that toe drags which is obviously a big problem, 'cause it can cause you to fall down. Okay. - So it could be weakness in the hip or in the foot itself. - Exactly. - Or anywhere along the chain there might be causing you difficulty. - It's a good point. And that's what therapists are thinking. And if you're not a therapist, you might see the foot drop and you might just think, ""Oh, the problem is down there."" - In the ankle. - In fact it may be up here, part of it is up here. - Right. - Another thing with foot drop is you might hear this - Foot slap - Foot slap. - Yeah. - It's the same problem. I've got a patient that I've been working with recently and he has this: his toe goes out to the side and he's dragging it. - That's very common too. - Right. Exactly. So we're gonna show you a couple of really neat tricks on how to do that in just a little bit. Okay. If things are going okay with a walker and you can go a hundred feet, couple hundred feet, on the flat and think, well, maybe we should progress to the cane. "
2521,How to check if someone with a cane and who suffered a stroke is ready to start walking?,04:12,06:40,252,400,864,GSbjwzyuUoo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSbjwzyuUoo,"- Sure. - So Bob, why don't you show some examples with a cane? - So I'm gonna move the cane forward then my foot. - Yeah. - I might have trouble moving that foot forward. - Right. So, and this is very typical. You're gonna use the cane on the opposite side. This leg is good. He's got pretty good balance between the cane and here, but that stroke leg is really having a hard time coming forward. Okay. This is a technique that I've used over the years and it works really well. We'll go- - We'll face this way. Yeah. - Straight towards. So what you're gonna do is, Bob has a gait belt on so I'm gonna use that to grab, always have a gait belt if there's a risk for fall, and I'm gonna come around, I call it the hip-hugger technique, around here and my hip is going to Bob's hip, and I got pretty good control. I'm not being shy here. I need to know where his hip is and I need to help guide it. So Bob's having a hard time bringing that right foot forward. And I'm not gonna drag it forward by reaching down and grabbing it. I'm gonna throw his right hip forward. And there it goes. - Yeah. And I didn't do anything there. He lifted it for me. - Yep. - So he's really pulling on my pelvis here. - Right. - Is what you're doing. - Right. - And you're pulling it up and around like that. And you know, after time you can maybe help a little bit less. - Exactly - And you're hoping I do more and more over time. - Right. One thing I'll do is I'll give a lot of verbal cues. Okay, Bob, bring that right foot forward. Bring it forward. Just like that. Bring it forward. There you go. Up too far. Bring it back where it belongs. Back. There you go. Okay, take the next step. Bring the cane forward. Now bring that right foot forward. I'm gonna help you. And there we go. And actually these muscles over here in the hip, I'll kind of bump a little bit, to kinda wake 'em up. Anything to get his brain to communicate with that right side. - Yeah. Get more visual or feedback. - Right. Whether it's verbal and you can use visual. And the way you do that is you put a mirror, a full-length mirror in front of the person, and then you do that together. And once the person can see that leg, sometimes... - They can make the connection. - Right. There's a lot of little tricks - Right. - That therapist use with strokes and these are just a few of 'em. - Yeah. You wanna give as many senses, you're gonna bring in as possible. So, you know, you got auditory and visual and then you can also feel. - Right, tactile. - Tactile, right. - So you got three things going all at once. It's very, it's taxing for the person with the stroke because they're working very hard and the mind isn't ready for it yet but you have to push it. - Yep. You have to get start hoping some of the other parts of the brain are gonna help out. "
2522,How to prevent the toes from dropping while walking if you suffered a stroke?,06:40,10:04,400,604,864,GSbjwzyuUoo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSbjwzyuUoo,"some of the other parts of the brain are gonna help out. - Okay. Now let's go to the technique, if the person has foot drop and that toe is dragging and you're trying to get that toe up so that it'll swing through. And this is where, if you're at home, and you're gonna need some TheraBand or some stretch band, where I'm gonna actually recommend the brand named TheraBand because if you go online and if you look, they sell it in five yard or six yard lengths, otherwise you gotta buy a big roll like they do at the therapy department. - Yeah. And those are expensive - For 150, $200 and you don't need that much. - Right. - And then they sell other ones, they're only five feet long. Well, that's not long enough. You need something that's gonna be about two to three yards long, and it will break. Mine broke here and I don't really know why. If you get it on a sharp edge it broke. This one just broke. I tied a knot in it. - This is some pretty thick stuff. Isn't it? - Well, you're gonna want to get, not the yellow, that's the lightest, you're gonna probably want the orange or the red. That's the colors I'd recommend to the TheraBand. - Okay. - Okay. So. - So you have a length. How long, Brad? - Well, if you double it up, it should come up shoulder at least, because of the knot this got shorter. I liked up the chin. - Okay. - If you double it, it should go to the chin. I'm gonna make this work. It's a little forgiving because it's a stretch. Step on it, at the mid-lengths. You're gonna cross it, double cross it, make the cross down by the toe. Then you're gonna go behind the knee. There you go. See how the X going across the knee. We're gonna go to the front, make a cross across the front. And then we're gonna go around and you can tie it back here. Or if you have long enough loops, tails, you can - You might be able to tie it in the front. - Exactly. I'm not gonna tie a knot in there 'cause I'm gonna hold it. Now I showed my wife this and she said, ""That's dangerous because this is gonna cut circulation off to their leg."" And that's a good point, but you're only gonna leave this on while you're working with a person for 20 minutes. - Right. This is not on all day. - Right. You don't put this on and then leave the person walk around with it all day. 'Cause it is a circulation problem at that point. - Yeah, I think it would take a while before it started cutting off circulation - Yeah. And we're being pretty conservative. But sometimes you need to be that way. So what's happening here is a TheraBand is literally pulling my toe up and behind here, it's keeping my knee, remember the hyperextension we talked about, it helps prevent that, and it gives support around the hip. - It's giving maybe a little bit of hip flexion? Or not? - A little bit. Yeah. 'Cause it's pulling right here. Yeah. Right. - It really works the chain the way musc- - It really stabilizes things without, and yet you can move but yet it helps. - Right. - I mean, unlike a knee immobilizer, which just, you know, locks you in place and you're not able to move at all. - This flows with the body. - Right. - So to speak. So normally I was walking like this. And then if you put something like this on a real patient, all of a sudden, you get it, it starts to go through. And you don't need all that help that I was giving Bob before. Okay. Now. - And once that happens, you know, the person can make the connection and they can start using their own, you know, hopefully make the neural connections, and start using their own body to do it. - Right. With repetition. - Right. - The mind starts to take over and it remembers, oh yeah. And it makes the new synapses, if you will. There's a, heh, I don't wanna get into all the details, that's pretty complicated. "

They're turning their foot outward, which is very common after a stroke. 'Cause they, a lot of times that hip adductor comes back first before the hip flexor. - Should we do this one on you Bob? - Sure. - Okay. You can use the same length TheraBand, put that around the toe and this is easier to do it on someone else. And I'm gonna put two wraps down around the toe to keep it semi-tight around the toe. - So you went, you crossed over twice. - Yep. You can do it once. I'm doing it twice. You work with it a little bit and you'll know the little tricks. That's if you're a little bit, just do a little experience. Now, the toe goes out this way. We're gonna go the opposite direction - Going in between the legs first. - Yep. And then we come around - So basically you're gonna make a spiral. Right, Brad? - Yep. The opposite direction - Yeah. - Of the problem. I like this, go right behind the knee. Okay. - Okay. I'm gonna bring it there. I take that. I didn't mean behind the. In fact, I actually- - Behind the calf. - Yeah. Yeah. - Not behind the knee. Behind the calf. - Bob's really tall. So normally with him... - You ran outta room, huh? - Yeah. We'd have to have another, another three or four feet to go around his waist. - So another one would go underneath here? - Nope. At this point- - Oh this one goes around the waist then? Oh yeah, I gotcha. - And what I like to do is at this point I'm gonna wrap it around here. - Oh like this. - Right. And then I'm gonna go like that. We may have to hold it here. And you can work with this or you can just go right to here and go through a belt loop. - Yeah. I would take it around and then tie it right here. - Yeah. Go ahead and walk towards the camera then. Do you feel how that pulls your toe in? - Yeah, it's really hard to turn my foot out right now. This works out really good. 'Cause this is a real problem with a lot of people. And it gives me a little bit of lift on the foot too, Brad. - I'm sure. Go ahead. Walk forward, Bob. - So yeah. It's definitely, it almost feels like I'm a robot on this side that, you know, it's assisting my leg. - Right. - It's really weird. - It is. And you know, you can do this for, and hopefully the idea is you're only gonna do this for a couple weeks. And after that the muscles regenerate the connections and strength and you don't need it anymore. - I really like this idea, Brad. It's really a good progression. - It is. It's a neat little trick that works really well. And it doesn't cost $2,000, like if you get a custom brace made that sometimes they work and sometimes they don't. "

So the first one Brad and I have been doing for years, I mean, therapists have been doing this for years. It's a great one, you know, like after surgery and if you're just having some pain, that's the one you start off with. You're trying to get some motion in the shoulder and you're trying to get it to relax. So you start off, this is called the Codman's or the pendulum exercise. You're lean on a chair. You're going to work this shoulder and watch my tie. You can actually see that I'm not moving the tie at all, but the pendulum of my body is moving it. And that's what works best for your arm. Don't be like that. Actually let the pendulum move it back and forth and you can go back and forth this way. And you're going to go in a circle and my tie's going to go in a circle. - Yeah you really got to get that body moving. The whole goal is when I explain this to my patients, I say, pretend your arm is like that tie. Or like it's completely jell-o. There's no muscle in it. It doesn't move unless the body moves. And then the weight of your arm serves as the vehicle for traction. - For just traction and also for relaxation because those muscles tend to get tight. So again, forward and back, side to side, and circle one way and circle the other way. - You're going to spend maybe one to two minutes there at the most. - It's a good one to do throughout the day. - The further you bend over, we always, I always have people lean on something with a hand. So your back doesn't get sore just in case you have back problems. You can actually do it from this angle and work your way down. - That's one thing I forgot to show Brad though. This is one thing, it's a sneaky way of getting motion. So let's say I can get it moving up to here. If I stand up, look how far my shoulder's up. So it's a sneaky way of getting motion in the shoulder too and that's why-- - We're not recommending that you do that. - No, no. - Unless it doesn't hurt. - Right but we're showing you how much motion you actually are getting. - That exercise has been given for more, You could try that pretty much with any sore shoulder and it'll probably offer relief. Unless there's some unusual thing. But doctors give that so many times without even telling them to go to therapy. "
2556,How to hang down to treat shoulder impingement?,04:39,06:43,279,403,683,24fh6lUG0yg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24fh6lUG0yg,"without even telling them to go to therapy. The next one, however, this one is a little more aggressive, oftentimes used for impingement. So if you have pain here and over that, it's probably an impingement. This one does. And we're using the book that I referred to before. - Yeah again, shoulder pain, the solution and prevention. We'll have a link below. Dr. Kirsch really, he's a retired orthopedic surgeon. Really cool guy. And this also works well for rotator cuff injuries. So he has example after example and testimonial after testimonial that talks about how this works. - And this could be used for a frozen shoulder, depends on what phase you're in. - Yeah if you're in the sawing phase, not the unsawing phase. - Yeah, if your shoulder only goes this high it's not going to work. But if you're up to about here, you can start to do this and you can use a pull-up bar. If this was a pull bar, and it's nice to not have it so high you have to jump for it, so you can just grab it and gently let your body down. We found the next thing better than a pull-up bar is actually have these hanging handles. One of the reasons I really like them is because I can lean up against the wall so my posture is perfect. And I can slowly slide my body down against the wall to get the traction I want. 'Cause when you first start, you don't want to have your full body weight, again, no pain. So if I go down, I got 50% body weight that might be comfortable, but I go further then you get pain, just go to where it's not painful. And then after a few days of doing this, it will, and I'm actually treating this. I have an impingement problem in my left shoulder right now from swimming. So I'm treating it right now. So I'll do a little treatment right now and I can actually, I feel comfortable doing this. Actually it feels good. And I'll hold it for 15 to 30 seconds and then you'll give it a break and maybe do it two to three times. The book is excellent. I think it's only like $10.

It's pretty close to it. - It does similar action on the shoulder. - We have the Booyah Stik here. You could use any stick as long as it's kind of got grip on it. I mean, it would need like maybe tape on on the bottom, or. - Yeah or, you could use some of this stuff right here. Liner, shelf liner. You don't want it to slip on the floor or the chair, you'll see. - So if you're shorter, you can actually probably put it on the floor. And let's say, my shoulder only goes up this high. So what you're going to do is you put it in place here and you're going to lean forward like this and you can see that I'm actually pulling on the shoulder and getting traction. - The humerus is pulling this way, little traction on that joint and you can control it. That's a really nice thing about this. You can control the force by how far you lean, if it gets really good, then you can bring the Booyah Stik-- - I was just gonna mention Brad, with arthritis, I've had many patients that started with this and they were only able to get the arm up this high. And they started by this, they love it because then they can see the progress. Like oh, now I can move up a little higher. - We should put stripes on the Booyah Stik. - Yeah we should, we should add like a-- - Put some numbers on it. - Yeah. - And they, they work their way up. But yeah, as Brad was alluding to, if you get up on the char, especially a tall person like me, I can go all the way up now and now I can lean forward and really get-- - Now you're getting close to-- - Yeah, now I'm getting that. This is, I mean, you can put force on this. - So this is where you really have to have something, either a cushion chair or something that doesn't slip. - Right, but this is nice because you can do it without the handles, I mean, you can do it anywhere.

2558,How to stretch the shoulder with a chair and belt to treat shoulder pain?,08:32,10:22,512,622,683,24fh6lUG0yg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24fh6lUG0yg,"- All right. And the last one, this one is actually... - Invented by Brad! - Yeah so be careful with this one. But I found, you know, it offers some relief to my shoulder. If you have a chair, and you have a couple of rungs down here, this is a stool, but a chair and you can take a belt belt and you have to get the belt the right length. So I already adjusted it. I'm going to put it right here in the crux of my elbow, put my hand on my thigh and now I'm just going to lean like this and I'm going to relax the shoulder and I'm going to test it, put a little traction. So as I lean forward, the belt's stationary, there's traction on it now. And if it feels good, I'll hold it for, you know, 10 to 15 seconds. - And it's funny, I palpated, which is means I touched Brad and felt there and you can actually feel a gap. - Yeah, they call it the sulcus sign. But again, only gonna do this if it feels good while you're doing it. And then when you're done, it should still feel good. If it feels good while you're doing it and you can take it off, it's like, oh, it kind of irritated it, the bet's off you're not going to do it. It has to feel good before and afterwards. - I actually think this would feel good on arthritis, even, Brad. Because arthritic joint, gives some distraction. And it actually can stretch that joint out a little bit. - The capsule. - The capsule, that's what I was trying to say. - I found that I've been using these loops for exercising at home. I just started recently, but they were good for this. They have a little stretch. It works better than a belt. - Yeah I've seen him used for stuff like this many times. - And so I'm gonna adjust it right there and just hold it here. And now there's some give and it's not like the belt works. Like you bottom out right away. This has a little give, it gives you a little more flexibility or not, I guess flexibility, variation on the pressure. So it works a little bit better, I like it. "

If it starts to leak through, you'll only add more bandage to the top of it, you never take away the bottom, because then it pulls the clots off and you start from scratch again. I still like to go with the elevation as long as there's no bone fracture, spinal cord involvement. That lets gravity work with us, not against us, but direct pressure normally "

You're gonna keep that direct pressure down We're gonna start at the distal end, or the end of the arm and work towards the heart. That way, we're not going to trap blood down in the hand any more than we have to. When you get to the top where the wound is you can put a little twist to the tie, which helps apply a little more pressure. "

If you have to sit we wanna make sure you're sitting with support. So you're gonna want to have some type of lumbar support. If you don't have one, all you have to do is roll up a towel and Brad's got his famous little duct tape on there or minor little duct tape. I don't know what that is and help hold it in place. - Right. So I always, and I think both of us say, sit on a firm upright chair. Avoid the soft cushy furniture. That's gonna promote that poor posture - A soft couch or a soft chair is gonna kill you. - Exactly. So here we got that firm chair and I'm gonna sit here and you'll find, you'll put that lumbar support right about the belt line. You'll know cause it's gonna feel good. You may have to adjust it per individual and right there. Now right now I can tell that this is a little bit too big. It's pushing my back out too far. - Yeah. You probably want more of a thinner one like this. - Yep and actually in my car, oh yeah that's better. I have one of these and I have another one that two of these are taped together and it depends on the day. Sometimes I'll use the one. Sometimes I'll put one with two in there. Sometimes I don't use it at all, but I've been working on my back for a long time. I kind of have it tuned in. - You kind of know what What is what, you know, what we have found. What I have found Brad with, with a lot of people is that when they're having problem with their herniated disc a lot of times they want more towel than less when they're doing preventative than they want less towel. But so you, that's the thing, you can take a towel and you can roll it up as big as you want. And try it and see, you know, what what helps and maybe have two sizes in your car. - Exactly. - Now, if you're on a couch you have to sit on a couch, take a throw pillow or something behind you and put it, you know, behind you. Or one of those recliners or whatever make sure you got, you know, like I said, a throw pillow cause you're really gonna sink in otherwise. "

One thing you wanna avoid with sleeping is I don't want you sleeping in a flexed posture all night, Brad. So I don't want you laying on your side. Where's my mic over here and laying like this all night long, you know, it's just again putting your back in that flex. Now there's not a lot of stress on your back in this position. - Right. - But it's just not it's better to be a bit straighter. - If you're one of those real strong, broad men that have wide shoulders. I mean, that can put your back at a angle this way as well. - Right and that's why we recommend quite often is, you could take a sheet. We also have something pre-made here, but you put the sheet in a roll. You're gonna spin it around like that. And I'm, this is kind of crude right now, Brad. - Right. - But some people actually tie a sheet around them. And then when they lay on their side, they got some support here. So they're not sagging here. And when they lay on their back they got some support and keep the arch there. - It's that hollow spot that's created by the pelvis right here. The back is gonna dip in right there where you gotta fill it in. So that'll straighten and neutralize that spine. - Good demonstration Brad. Now there's pre-made products too. Do you wanna show that one, Brad. That's a McKenzie, right? - Yep. This is a McKenzie sleep roll they call it. A McKenzie sleep roll. You put it around here. This is, this would be for a smaller person than me but you can tie it here. And if it was, if I had the right size, it would come like that here and then protect the back as well or support the back I should say - Let's show one little trick too, Brad, for sleeping with you got - Oh, I thought you were gonna do a magic trick. Oh, you're killing me, Bob. - I'm gonna make Brad disappear. - Yeah. - Okay. Actually, I'm gonna make you disappear. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna lay on your good side. Okay. So let's say my pain's going down my leg here. I'm gonna lay on my good side, which is this side. I'm gonna lay on my right side. And then I'm yeah, put the two pillows - I'll help you out here, Bob. - One pillow or two pillows underneath you like this with the leg bent and believe it or not sometimes that helps arch the back up a little bit on this side. And it helps relieve the stress and the pain down the leg. - But he would have pillows up by his head - I'd have pillows here too. - Yeah, I actually had a patient last year that I did this to her and she just was happy. It's like, oh, that feels so much better. - Yeah. A lot of people have trouble finding a correct position to sleep in at night. I know a lot of people tend to sleep in a recliner when they have back pain. I don't know why it helps. It does. I'd rather that you don't. Because you're sitting in that flex position somewhat. - It maybe someone has stenosis and they think it's a disc, you know, that may be one of those thoughts. - And then it would help. Yep. Exactly.

They're just bending and twisting it the whole time. - Gotta reach under to get under that chair. - So instead of what you should be doing is you should be dancing with it. You're dancing with the vacuum, moving your leg every time the vacuum moves, your leg moves. - And you actually walk with it too. Yeah, there you go. There you go. You can do the Waltz as you vacuum - Better yet, you get one of those little Roombas or whatever. Those little circular vacs that go up. - Yeah, like a little robot. - Yeah. Little robot.

2571,How to warm up the neck muscles?,00:18,03:32,18,212,782,u3Ocw5UIpYs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3Ocw5UIpYs,"To start off we're just going to get those muscles moving a little bit, warm them up, and then do the stretches. So to start off with, you're just going to rotate your head back and forth, but the thing you want to do is keep your chin up in this neutral position. So you don't want to drop it down, you want to keep it up, and then just rotate to the side. So we're just going to do five on each side and it can be kind of a continuous motion, you're just really kind of loosening everything up so you're not stretching those muscles cold because you don't really want to stretch muscles cold unless you have to like first thing in the morning. But other than that you really want to kind of loosen them up a little bit. So that's five on each side. Then the next one is going to be a side bend. So you're taking your ear down towards your shoulder, but it's not bringing your shoulder up, it's bringing that you're down. But again keep that head kind of in that neutral position, and then just go down your ear towards the shoulder and then alternate back and forth. So again just just do about five of these, you're really just kind of loosening everything up. You don't have to go super slow. You don't have to go super fast. You're just trying to get those muscles kind of awake and ready to go. A little bit warm so when you're stretching you can actually get some benefit from the stretch. And then the last one of the movement is just going to be an up-and-down. Now with the going back up this way be a little careful if you have neck issues because sometimes this can make people feel dizzy. So you know if that makes you feel dizzy going all the way up just bring it up a little bit. Bring your eyes up, and then bring your chin towards your chest. So again just about five of these. These kind of stretches work really well for headaches or if you have some neck spasms, or maybe if you strain it. A lot of times people wake up with a crick in the neck. Sometimes these really help as well. So let's just do one more of each of those. Then the next one to get everything going before we go into the stretches is the chin tuck. And it's not chin tuck going down this way, it's chin tuck coming in this way. So you can have lots of chin to make you look like like you got lots of folds in the neck, but that's kind of what you want to do. So it's something you might not want to do around a whole lot of other people unless you don't care. But basically what i like to do to know that you're doing it correctly, is place your finger on your chin and then move that chin away. So this time you're going to hold it for about three seconds, doesn't have to be exact and then come back, And then you can see that I kind of corrected myself. And then you can move it again. Do that just about three maybe five seconds and then relax. Come back in. Do that again, little hold. And again this is just kind of putting that spine in neutral position, getting those muscles where they're supposed to be, working everything a little bit. But see how my chin is going straight back, it's not coming down and talking in like that it's just going straight back. Almost like if I have my hand back there, and I'm trying to push into my hand. Ok now we're going to go into the stretches stretches, the best results for "
2572,How to perform an upper trap stretch for neck pain relief?,03:32,07:48,212,468,782,u3Ocw5UIpYs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3Ocw5UIpYs,"Ok now we're going to go into the stretches stretches, the best results for stretches is holding it for 30 seconds and doing three of each of them. So I'm going to use my timer to get the stretches in. We're going to start off with just a trap stretch, your upper traps, and what I like to do with the hand of the side you're stretching is really just kind of hang it down. If you have a chair that you can hold on to, hold onto it because that keeps the shoulder down because if you're stretching and your shoulder comes up, you're not really stretching those upper trap muscles. So what I'm going to start this and we're going to get going. Just take the opposite hand and pull over. So getting a nice stretch in there, nice hold.You want those stretches to be comfortable. You don't want pain in there. If you happen to feel little pop, but it's not painful, that's ok that's just your spine kind of adjusting itself and realigning itself. But if it's painful definitely stop. But again this is really good for like those neck spasms you have. A lot of times tension headaches you just need to get that stretch in there and that really helps loosen it up. Sometimes you can alternate sides, I like alternating sides just because you get the other side a little bit of a break. If you don't alternate sides, then you want to give yourself about a 5-10-second break in between. So let's go ahead and do the other side. So holding it down onto that chair, and then pulling over to the other side. Again, try and keep that head in this kind of neutral position. So I'm not turning down this way, I'm just looking straight ahead and trying to pull that ear towards the other side. So you should feel that stretch kind of right in through there. You might see my muscle coming out just a little bit and that just means that it's stretching. It should feel good, that good kind of hurt not that just hurt, hurt. If it's just a hurt, then it's probably something that you really really need to go get checked out. All right and the other side. Nice stretch there, nice and relaxed. And sometimes if your muscles are really tight and they start to loosen up, you might be holding here, and then you don't feel the stretch quite as much anymore and then just give it a little bit more of a pull until you feel that tension again. So you don't have to hold it in that same spot the whole time, you can push it a little bit, again, if it's not painful. You know stretching's uncomfortable. Maybe hurts a little bit, but it feels good kind of thing. Remember again if you feel like it's something that's trying to to pop in there, if it's not painful, that's ok but if it hurts. If it's like ""oh that just doesn't feel right,"" definitely stop. Because the neck is something that you you don't want to be pulling and tugging on it if there's something not good going on in there. This is really just for, you know, muscle strain, those tension headaches, maybe a spasm in there something like that. Just to kind of get everything moving there again. Nice hold. Starting to feel those muscles getting warmed up there. Nice and lose nice and comfortable. Nice deep breath. Alright, let's go back to the other side. Again keeping that shoulder down. See if I don't hold on, it kind of comes up a little bit. So you really want to kind of hold it down. And then just get that nice stretch in there. If you have a little bit of a headache, sometimes just taking some deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth, gets some extra oxygen in there, and that helps with the circulation. That sometimes makes you feel better as well. So just kind of a, and sometimes that helps those muscles relax just a little bit as well. "
2573,How to perform a levator scapulae stretch for neck pain relief?,07:48,12:33,468,753,782,u3Ocw5UIpYs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3Ocw5UIpYs,"So the next one is going to be for your levator scap muscle. And the reason you want to stretch that one out is that muscle in the back there a lot of times you're like ""oh that hurts right there,"" that's that's where that levator scap muscle is. It comes up, and if you have a lot of tension, a lot of times people hold their tension like this. And that's putting a lot of stress on that muscle, so if you stretch it out, a lot of times you can get that tension out of there. This one's kind of a weird position. If you have shoulder if issues, you might have to modify a little bit, but the side you want to stretch, you're going to bring that hand up this way. Almost where your elbow's trying to go up towards the ceiling. It doesn't have to go all the way up, it can be about here, but that's the goal is to try and get it up. And then take the other hand, put it behind your head and go out at an angle. So it's almost like you're trying to take your head over towards your opposite knee. So it's kind of at that angle. So it's going to be this motion. Get that started, have to reset it first. And then we can go. So behind my head and pulling over. So again it's going to be more at an angle now and that's kind of getting that levator scapulae muscle. And and that one is as a big cause of tension, lot of pain, and it's connected to the scapula and that has over 20 muscle attachments to it so anytime one of those muscles, or several of those muscles, aren't working correctly, it can cause a whole lot of problems in the neck, upper back, and shoulder areas. So this is definitely something you really want to stretch. Now we're going to switch sides. Up this way and then pulling a cross. S o again I'm almost looking at that opposite knee. It's not over here, it's not straight down, it's kind of an angle. You're going to feel it in that area right through there. And again you want to be that comfortable. You don't want to be painful. Just a nice tension, nice stretch in there. The great thing about these, is you can easily do them at your desk. If you're working a lot, a lot of times people tend to kind of get their head going forward, leaning in towards the computer, and then you're so busy what you're doing on the computer that two hours later you look up and you have a lot of neck pain and upper back pain because you've been a terrible position the whole time. So just doing some of these stretches while you're sitting there even, if you're at work is pretty easy to do without having to get on the ground or get any kind of equipment or anything like that. And back again. Try and keep your back pretty upright as well don't kind of pull it forward, that takes away from that stretch a little bit. If you do some that's okay, sometimes if you're stretching and nobody's watching, you're not quite sure, but just kind of push back into the chair every once in a while to make sure that you're sitting fairly upright and so then end up making your back sore as well. Nice big stretch. Make sure that you have some deodorant on because you're right there in that armpit. Then you then you can do the sniff check without being obvious. You're like ""no I'm just doing some stretches right now."" Luckily my Lord of the Ring Kitty's got me covered. Smelling good. Alright and now for the last one on this side. Up and hold. Stretch on this side, nice and relaxed. And again if you feel like it's hurting, a lot of times the reason you don't want to stretch if you're having a lot of pain is because your muscles go into what we call muscle guarding. And you can try push on and push on it, but if they're guarding, they're actually just pulling back. And so that extra pain lots of times is counter beneficial of the stretching. So those were your stretches for your neck to make sure "
2574,How can i relieve shoulder pain with a pendulum shoulder blade roll?,00:26,01:47,26,107,513,Ggpvl0XagW4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ggpvl0XagW4,"respond to my subscribers. so the first stretch / exercise is going to be pendulums for shoulder pain. and these are one of my favorites. and when I had shoulder surgery, this really helped loosen everything up and made it feel a lot better. so with the shoulder pendulums, it's kind of like it sounds. you're making your arm like a pendulum, but you really want it to be as passive as it possibly can. if you have a lot of shoulder pain, if you're not on any precautions, or if you're not on post-op surgery where you'd have things that you're not allowed to do, you can actively move it a little bit. but I find that if you really just let your arm hang down and relax and move it with your body, that makes it feel a lot better because just the arm hanging down really opens up that joint and it makes it just feel so much better. so with this one, you're just gonna make some circles. so you can see I'm probably activating it a little bit, it's really hard to make something completely passive when you're awake, but really using the body to make most of that movement. so you can do maybe like ten one way, and then reverse it and go back the other way just to get it nice and loosened up. you can also do a front to back motion where you're just kind of rocking your body and that shoulder is following along with it. and then you can even do like a side to side. so again this is really nice, you don't necessarily have to do four reps if you want to just do thirty seconds worth of each and build your time up to one minute doing it a couple times a day, you can do that. that makes it feel really really good. the next one would be table "

I'm just gonna do, demonstrate it on the chair. so we don't actually have to go to a table or move anything differently, but you want a flat surface. you want it to be pretty smooth. if you need something like a towel to help it slide you can, but most the time you can just kind of move it very nicely on like a tabletop or again like a chair or something. but you know if you have knee issues you probably don't want to sit like this, but you can do a countertop too because then you can stand up and do it a little bit easier. when you put your arm out in front of you on the counter, or the chair, or the table, put your thumb in an upward position. this helps open up that shoulder joint. if you go this way it'll put it in a little bit more of an impinged position, and it might be more uncomfortable. so I like having people start off this way. and all you're gonna do is you're using the support of whatever it's on, and you're just sliding forward. so see as I slide forward it's stretching out that shoulder. so I'm getting that stretch, but I'm having something support it so it's not that I'm actively doing it. I'm actively assisting doing it. and so just going as far as you comfortably can and coming back up. again you can just start off with five or ten. you can also go in different directions. so if you wanted to do like a scaption motion which would be almost like that 45 degree angle, you can slide it this way. you could even turn completely to the side and do like an abduction motion sliding it out. but just go till you feel some tension. don't go till you feel pain, and if you want to hold it there once you get that tension for two or three seconds really just to get that stretch in there, you can. so you can kind of just continuously go back and forth or you can hold a little bit and get a nice stretch in there. so again maybe just starting off with five to ten in each direction doing that a couple "

I see a lot of my patients try and do this, but that's changing the exercise. that's not quite getting external rotation anymore. so keep those elbows by your side, keep those wrists in that neutral position, and really just control that band. so it's not fast, it's nice and smooth, especially the coming back in motion. so when you're using a resistive bands, if you haven't used them before, again I'd start off with low reps, five to ten. you know ten to fifteen. but you just do couple sets and then a couple times throughout the day. but I'd rather you do less and then build it up so you don't get super sore while you're doing "

You will need A large piece of cloth A pair of scissors And a long, thin piece of cloth and a long-sleeved shirt or sweater (optional) (optional). Step 1. Cut a large piece of cloth into a square that is at least 40"" on each side. If necessary, dress any wounds or make a splint before putting the arm in a sling. Step 2. Fold the cloth diagonally in half, forming a triangle. Step 3. Drape the triangle so its base runs up and down the chest opposite the injured side, with the top corner dangling over and behind the shoulder on the uninjured side, and the bottom corner hanging below the waist. The corner opposite the base should wrap part way around the waist, lying between the torso and the injured arm's elbow. Step 4. Gently support the injured arm at the elbow across the torso. Step 5. Lift the bottom corner up so the sling now cradles the injured arm. The hand should extend just past the base of the triangle and the elbow should be supported by the corner that's opposite the base. Drape that same corner you just lifted over and behind the shoulder above the injured arm. Step 6. Tie the two corners that are behind either shoulder to each other so they loop behind the neck, adjusting the knot so the elbow is bent at a right angle, not drooping low or pulled too high. If you don't have a piece of cloth available, use a long-sleeved shirt or sweater. Simply tie the sleeves together behind the neck and anchor the arm with the body of the shirt. Step 7. To further immobilize the arm, wrap a long, thin piece of cloth around the body to keep the arm securely against the body. "

We have a number of cardiac stress tests that we perform and a lot of it depends upon what we're looking for and the level of the patient's ability to perform a test. With our cardiac stress testing, obviously we try to get patients to perform exercise. Exercises the best way to stimulate the heart and to get an accurate view of how the heart is responding.

2581,How to treat neck spasms with neck stretches?,00:20,02:36,20,156,184,Gn9lSUG0mcI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn9lSUG0mcI,"are never fun. So let's get started. For the first exercise, just take you hands and kind of clasp them behind your head and your neck area. Bend your head forward, tucking that chin in, and by using your elbows to help give you some motion, just rotate you head back and forth. So you're kind of pulling through with that bottom elbow just to give you a little stretch in there. You can just move back and forth like I am about 10 times, or you can kind of pause there and hold it for about 3-5 seconds. Stretching one way, and then doing that maybe 5 times with a 3-5 second hold. The next one you can still take your hands and kind of now clasp them a little bit higher up on your head, so not necessarily in the curve, but higher up. And then this time, just use your elbow on the top to kind of push over. So now it's more of a side bending kind of motion. So reaching one way, and then coming back. So same thing, you can either just kind of do a continuous motion side to side, or you can hold it there for about 3-5 seconds, and do about 5 of those. The last stretch you're gonna need a towel. Something long enough to actually wrap around you a little bit. Now don't try strangling yourself, this is kind of an awkward motion. But with the towel on your left side, you want to actually take your right hand and grab it. And then the towel part on your right side, grab with your left hand. You're going to bring it about where your ear is and then across your face. Just really comfortably right there. That's why you want to use a towel so it doesn't hurt. And go up at an angle. Almost like towards the crease in of the ceiling, and then pull to the side, while you're taking your other hand and pulling downwards. So this is just gonna give ya an extra tight rotation stretch there. Hold this one for about 15-20 seconds if you can. And then come back down, switch sides, holding here, pulling up here, and going towards the other side. There you have it! Wooo, those were the stretches for neck spasms. If you have any questions, leave them "

Cyriax, Dr. Cyriax came up with this decades ago. - Right, he's long gone. He's been gone for 30 years I think. - So again, let's assume that the pain is down here by the patella or the kneecap. And you know, that's commonplace the fibers of the muscle and as well as a tendon go this direction. So we're going to go on this area, find that painful spot. And if you can push on it and we're gonna go across the fibers this direction. If you can move back and forth across, or no, you could use both hands or your fingers like this. Now, if you push down in it, we're not going to go superficial on the skin. We're going to push into those fibers. What we're going to do is break up the scar tissue. That's starting to heal as it's getting better. And we're going to make that scar tissue heal up in a healthy, strong manner, right? And we're not going to get into a lot of details. - [Bob] And you also get more blood flow to the area, which helps it heal faster. - Exactly. Now, if this is a painful spot and you go over it and it's like, Oh God, that really hurts yet. Hold off on it. You may want to just work you can work above it, you could go below it, but you're getting into the kneecap. You're not going to massage your kneecap, but you can't get up above it and let these muscles relax. Get the muscles to relax. That takes pressure off of the injured site as well. - And you can do this throughout the day because this is a difficult massage to do with your hands. - Exactly. - They fatigue. And there, they just don't really get into the muscle because this is a big heavy muscle. - Right. - One of your biggest muscles that you have. - Let's say you've got that injured spot there and you start to go on it and it hurts, but now I want you to pay attention if after about 15 to 30 seconds it starts to feel. Oh, it doesn't hurt so much anymore. It actually feels kind of good or it feels kind of numb-ish. Then you're a gold in there. You're going to keep working. - That's the key to this. - Yeah. - If you do this and it starts hurting worse and worse and worse, it's too flared up yet. You're going to want to go ahead and back off, maybe ice it some more. But if you're able to tolerate this and it actually starts to improve, like Brad said. This is the exercise or the massage for you. - And you'll do it, Cyriax says up to 20 minutes which is pretty much impossible because your fingers get really tired. Then you get tendonitis in your fingers. Or a problem with your finger joints. But you can do this until your fingers get tired. Give it a break and then come back a few hours later and do it again.

Believe it or not and that's where this round head it comes with a bunch of head attachments. - They both come with five different heads. Obviously, you know, you're not going to use this one around your patella, yeah that's a whole nother. - So I just gently rolled on top of the patella. There have been some scar tissue there Brad. So if you look at Brad's knee, I'm rolling it right. And I actually was comfortable through my clothes. - Now see, now these travel this way and we're doing it sideways for a reason. Because if we went up and down. - [Bob] Look at the bump, bumping on mine Brad. - It's actually pretty painful. So that's, and that's just what, you would do that, if it was up in the muscle belly. - Yeah, then you can hit. - Then you may go that direction but we're going to go sideways and get that cross friction benefit over that tendon. And it's not gonna irritate the patella. And again, now, - Now if this makes your pain worse, don't do it. If you do it on the, hit the top of the kneecap and ah! - Ooh. - But it felt so good to me, I kid you Brad, it was 80% better within two treatments of this. - Oh really? - I mean it seriously was. - And your fingers didn't get sore. - No, no.

Hold the area under cool, gentle running water. You can also use bottled water or saline wound spray. Remove any debris by rubbing gently  with a clean cloth or use clean tweezers. Don't apply any disinfecting solutions to the wound. They don't help and will only cause pain. Use a bandage to cover the wound until a scab has formed. Change the dressing every day or more often if it gets wet or dirty. Once a cut or scrape has formed a  scab, you can leave it open to the air. "

We have found, or we have not found, McKenzie kinda discovered this. Let's say, for example, your knee doesn't straighten out all the way. Can you bring the chair over here, Brad? - Sure, Bob. - And I'll just... I was gonna put my leg up on it. - Oh, I thought I could sit down, it's got a backrest. - I was just gonna do it like this. Let's say, for example, you have the slightest... The knee doesn't straighten out all the way. Regaining that full range of motion often will take stress off the knee. That's hard to believe. Maybe a better example would be the hip, Brad. If you check your hips, and you put one leg up like this on your opposite leg, and one knee is up like this, because the hip is tight, and the other knee goes way down like that. Stretch the one that's tight. Especially if it coincides with your hip pain. Give it a stretch, pressure on, pressure off.

It's always good to still keep... The stronger the joint is, the less stress there is on the joint. And one way that Brad and I have discovered, that really is a great way to gentle strengthening, without putting as much stress on the joint, is to use strengthening bands or tubes. - Right, obviously this is something that any therapist... We've been using these for 20, 30 years-- - Oh, we've got things in the way. - Oh my goodness, we've got obstruction. Let's get rid of those! - Okay, how are we doing? Are we okay? We're finding Brad? - Yeah, so we've got the bands with the handles. These work really nice, 'cause the handles, you've got a nice soft device to grab onto. And it's nice to have something to hold onto on the wall. - [Bob] We have our wall anchors, so we'll have that listed down below too. But as a good example here... Brad, your tag is sticking out here, this bothers me. - No, cut that off. - [Bob] So, as a good example here, I was really having a lot of elbow pain with doing curls, with the regular barbell. So I had to adjust and actually start using these for a while. I actually went back to the barbell now. - You did. - 'Cause I went through a period of doing this for a couple of months. And I like it, but I wanted to go a little heavier weight, and so I went back to that. But that allowed me to restrengthen my joint and not have as much pain. So I don't feel it any more. - I'll never go back to the barbells. - Yeah, I know! - I love the bands. I've got a whole system set up, and there's nothing better. For me. "

If you have osteo-arthritis and you wanna get some relief, especially in the joints that are weight bearing, you wanna decrease the weight bearing. Simple as that. So when you're walking outside, one, you wanna avoid hills. You wanna avoid stairs even, too. You don't wanna overdo them. You wanna maybe try biking, that's one way to decrease weight bearing. You could also use a walking stick or a cane. And, you know, one thing I warn people is that... They go, ""Well, I'm not gonna use a cane, I look old."" Well, sometimes it's not a matter of permanent change. Sometimes if you do it just for a while, it calms the arthritis down, and then you can go back to walking without a device. - That cane's too short for Bob, by the way. - This is, and by the way, one point, too, to be made, is believe me, it probably looks better to walk with a cane than to walk like this. You know, 'cause you're limping so bad from the arthritis. So, it'll probably look a little better to walk with a cane, distinguished, like an English gentleman, than trying to waddle. - And when you waddle, then you're putting pressure on other joints and it compounds, and it causes one problem to another, "

So the first one is as Brad and I have had mentioned a few million times throughout our video life here. We're gonna start with a chin tuck and these can... I've had people that use these alone and it took away their headache. - Yeah, me too. - So basically you're gonna tuck your chin in. You're moving your head back. Brad's gonna be able to show it better. - You have to make sure it's a firm chair, upright back rest, hand, armrests are optional. Scooch your bottom back in, shoulders back and get good posture before you start this, and then tuck in so it's not down like this. It's a common mistake or-- - Up like that yeah. - It's straight back. - Now Brad's got pretty good motion there already. You may find that you have very little and that's why you're having headaches. So you know, if you only gonna have a slight bit of motions, light bit of translation, start with that little movement and you can actually add some over pressure, right, "

This is the second exercise. You can actually take your fingers or you can take the web of your hand and thumb and push it back like that. Now, with this case Brad, quite often what helps with headaches is actually to hold it for 30 to 45 seconds and let that pressure on, and if the pain gets worse, obviously you stop it, and if it doesn't get worse, you can actually do that for up to two minutes Brad. You can actually hold it for two minutes. - You'll know cause it's gonna continue to feel good. - Yeah, it's gonna feel good like, ""oh' that's all I've been looking for. - All right, so again, you're not gonna go on right away and push really hard on this. You know, you start out gentle and see how it responds. If it feels better as you put more pressure on it, then you can go a little more. - Now, another thing quite often that we find, and when we try to determine whether or not your headache is coming from the neck, we actually had you do a test where you see what your rotation is like, and quite often, a limitation in rotation can cause pain in the neck. So let's say, let's see, I wanna figure out which way. I'm gonna try this way. Let's say I'm limiting it to the right, I can go normal to left, but to the right, I started, ""Oh, it hurts even when I go that direction"". What you're gonna do is take a towel "

They start at the base of my head, at the base of my neck, I'm sorry. I mean the base of my skull. (Brad hums in agreement) But they move up into... Cause that's the hot orientation of the vertebrae. - Sure. - So I'm gonna switch hands here actually. I'm gonna take and grab with this hand and the other hand grabs the other side and that gets pulled down, okay? - I'm doing it with the towel roll. - Yeah. - Doesn't always work as good, but you know, sometimes it helps. - Yeah, you can do it, you can try that too. - Yup and then you're gonna... Yup, you do wanna make sure the shoulders go with you. It's just, you're gonna bring it across like this. Then you gonna cross the cheek up to the eyes and you're gonna... This should be by the way, completely pain-free. If this makes your pain worse, you're not gonna do it. And, but quite often we find with this support, that it feels better and you're able to actually move without the pain. So this arm is pulling down, it's not pulling across. (Brad chuckles) - It's pulling down and this one's-- - Yeah up high, if you go below your chin you just choke yourself. (Chuckles) - Yeah. - So it's not a good idea. - You can actually have someone give you a little bit extra push to it. - Oh, I thought you wanna do a high five. - (Chuckles) - Yeah. - But that may be too advanced for you. - Yeah that person may not be-- - Yeah, know what to do. So give that a try. You'd go the opposite direction. You'd, you know, switch your hands and go that way. I don't wanna do it cause I'm gonna hit my mic, but you can give that a shot too yourself. So five to 10 repetitions, see how it feels. If it feels all right, you can keep doing this throughout the day. Also six to eight times a day. All right, next one is, sometimes you have tightness in there "

The thumb point towards the floor and you can put it under your chin and you can pull forward that way, and you got to do it gently, 'cause you can actually get quite a bit of leverage that way. (Brad hums in agreement) You can actually... But that's a different way to get a little more stretch. That's a Mulligan technique. - Your fist is actually between your jaw bone and right on the top of the sternum where you have that little hollow spot. - It's just a leverage point so that you're actually putting a little bit "

So what Brad's doing is you're gonna do first circles right, where the neck meets the skull, and this really can quite often find the side that's... One, the side that's a lot more painful, but it's amazing how you can really, decrease the pain levels and decrease the stress in the neck and the muscles by doing just some simple self massage. You wanna do a kind of a splain one too Brad? - Yep. - So he's pulling... Puts the figures together and he pulls them apart, and you kinda do this one too Brad where you do it on the neck too, don't you? - Oh yeah, yeah down lower. - Down lower yeah he pulled... - [Brad] I don't know if anybody's hearing me right now. - Yeah. People are probably not hearing , but just experiment around with it. You can't hurt things. You just go ahead and give it a try and see if it feels better. "

Bobby you act like you never did it before. - I didn't. (Both laugh) It's the first time I've done it, but it actually feels quite good. - Yeah, so the balls are close together.

So you can see that there's nerves running across here. That's gonna create that shooting and zapping. So as that toe is swollen, that's what causes those pain and symptoms. So you could see, there's a lot of tendons. Here is the actual joint right here. And then you have your actual toe right here. So the problem is you wanna stop it from rubbing and bumping against your foot. And you also wanna stop it from bending like this. So you can see that's what's gonna cause you your pain is when that toe's bending like this. So what you can do is number one, you could see there's these gel pads that can slip on the toe. So the easiest thing right here, this will help. It's not perfect but you can see the gel pad goes on here. And when your foot turns out, it's gonna stop it from rubbing quite as much on the outside of the shoe. When you put your sock on, this stays tilted back. So the sock helps that. If it's just the tip of your toe, so if it's just the tip of this toe, you have this little guy right here. Some people affectionately call it like a, well, you already know it looks like but you can see these cones look really good. And then you also have this heavier duty one right here. So you could see this one goes on like this. And then you put your sock on and that'll protect the outside of your foot from rubbing. And you can see, I have it sitting on an orthotic. The orthotic provides some bend protection. So see, without the orthotic, how easily the foot bends. Whereas with the orthotic, see, it's a little bit harder to bend. It gives it a little bit more stability inside a good shoe. Also, if you have a good slipper inside the house, you can see the slipper. This slipper has an orthotic in here. So that can protect it. So you can see it in an orthotic slipper. An orthotic slipper right there could really help protect things. And another thing is you can see a shoe like this. What you want is I can feel the fifth toe right there. And what you can see with the shoe is it's all mesh right here. See where the stitching is right here? Some shoes have the stitching right here. So especially dress shoes. You wanna be careful where your fifth toe is that you only have mesh. Otherwise, your broken toe's gonna hurt. If you don't have these gel pads at home, what you can do is grab a Kleenex and a piece of tape. So what I'd like to do is a piece of duct tape. You rip the duct tape in half, right there. And here is all you do for your fifth toe. So here's the fifth toe but buddy fracture. So you take this. I like to pad in between the toe. And this right here, I just wrap it a few times. See what I'm doing? I just like to go up in between. So be careful so you don't injure your fifth toe. And then up above. And then up around like that. So you could see it's nice and padded. And then you take your tape right there. So see what I did? I just taped around here. And then you take your other tape like this. And right now you have yourself a toe cast right there. So that toe cast is the equivalent of something like this or something like this. "

They occur in areas where the sun doesn't shine. Most of us think that they're only in sun exposed areas, but this is a good example. And I think the really important points are that anything that's persistent on your skin and doesn't look like it belongs there. You should see a dermatologist. "
2651,How to improve the sense of smell?,01:26,04:02,86,242,274,ynrbxy36erE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynrbxy36erE,"Follow these steps and you too can change the way the world smells to you. First, stick your nose in it. Some animals that are known to be great smellers, like dogs who can sniff out explosives and pigs who can  find truffles underground, put their noses right at the place they want to smell. Human noses, meanwhile, are casting around in the middle of the air, giving us an anatomical disadvantage. So bring your nose close to the world around you. The ground, surfaces, objects, the food in your hand. Get close to your dog, your partner, the book you're reading. Not only will your nose be closer to the odor source, but the warmth of your breath will make odors easier to smell. Second, sniff like you mean it. Smelling actually happens way up near the bridge of our noses in a postage stamp-sized square of tissue called the olfactory epithelium. When we sniff, odor molecules are sucked up into our nostrils until they hit this tissue where they combine to our olfactory, or scent, receptors. When we inhale normally, only a little air makes it there. But one or two solid sharp sniffs will ensure that more air gets to your smell receptors. After just a few more sniffs, the receptors, which are best at noticing new smells, turn off temporarily. So you can give your nose a rest and sniff again later. Finally, dwell on the smell. Most smells pass by us  with little attention, but simply noticing what you're smelling and by trying to describe it, name it, and locate its source, you can expand your vocabulary of smells. When an odor molecule binds to a scent receptor, it sends an electrical signal from the sensory neurons to our brain's olfactory bulbs. The signal then continues to other areas of the brain, where it's integrated with taste, memory, or emotional information before registering to us as a smell. FMRI research shows that the extra time spent focusing on scent changes the brain of experienced smellers. For them, perceiving and imagining odors becomes more automatic than for non-experts.

I'm gonna place my hand on my head and then push into and you should see my muscles here activating a little bit, and just again a three to five second hold and then relax. I'm not pushing as hard as I can, especially the first couple times I do these isometrics. I'm doing maybe twenty to thirty percent of my push, and then later on the next day if that's not sore, then I can push forty to fifty and then 60 you know in the 70 and so it forth. but make sure you're doing both sides. then this is the movement I would do and then I'm pushing in three to five seconds and then relaxing. do five on each side, you can alternate back and forth if you want, or you can just do them all on one side and then do all on the other side, but make sure you're doing both sides. so the next isometric "

And what that does is that just keeps that shoulder down. you don't have to sit on it, but I feel like you're gonna get a better stretch. then all you're gonna do is take your other hand and pull your head gently towards the opposite side. like I'm trying to take that ear to the other shoulder. but keep the shoulder down. don't bring it up, but just gently pull over this way. and you should feel that stretch right in through here. so nice gentle stretch just holding that stretch. so since this is a full stretch you want to hold it for 30 seconds and then switch sides. so sitting here pulling it over gently getting that stretch and doing three on each side. again I like to alternate back and forth just because that makes it where you can give each side just a little bit of a break. so before I go on to my next exercise I "

It comes all the way up into the neck. so it could put a lot pressure on that neck or that cervical area. so this time the side that you want to stretch you're going to put your hand up where you're trying to bring your elbow up towards the ceiling. now sometimes people can't do that, that's okay. you can also just raise your arm up, but you don't have to do that either. this is just now that's pushing that shoulder blade or that scapula down to give you a better stretch. but you don't have to do that, I just feel like you're gonna get a better stretch. so I'm gonna bring this side up of the side that I want to stretch, and then I'm gonna take my other hand and put it behind my head. I'm gonna pull down at an angle about a 45 degree angle towards my opposite knee. so I want my nose to point towards my opposite knee when I'm going down. so I'm stretching this way. so it's not stretching to the side, it's not stretching forward, is stretching at that angle to really get that stretch right through back there. that's where you should feel that stretch. so again this is a full thirty second hold, and you want to do three on each side. so then the next stretch is going to be for your "

What you need to do is find a flat surface. You can do these in bed, on the couch, on the floor - whatever is comfortable for you. It just needs to be flat. We're going to start off by bending the knees and then we're gonna bring the legs up just like this - almost like a nice 90 degree angle. From there, I'm going to take my hands and place them on the sides of the knees. I'm then going to take the knees and try to drive them outwards while I resist against my hands. What that's going to do is help release tension in that SI joint. You might feel a popping sensation, that's completely normal. Again, that's just the gases escaping from the joint very rapidly. What I'd like to do is hold this one for short bursts - three to five seconds, kind of relax, and then do them upwards to ten times. The next part is going to be the opposite. We're going to go back into that same position but what we're going to do instead is squeeze into it. So we're going to take our hands and place them together (like that). Put them in between the knees, and then drive the knees inwards and resist against it with your hands. Again, you're gonna feel a quick tension release.
